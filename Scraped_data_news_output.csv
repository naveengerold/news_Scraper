"China's coronavirus lockdown curbs deadly pollution, likely saving the lives of tens of thousands, says researcher",['Ivana Kottasová'],"(CNN) The drastic measures enforced by China during the coronavirus outbreak have slashed deadly air pollution , potentially saving the lives of tens of thousands of people, a Stanford University researcher said.

""The reductions in air pollution in China caused by this economic disruption likely saved twenty times more lives in China than have currently been lost due to infection with the virus in that country,"" Burke wrote on G-Feed, a site run by a group of scientists researching the relationship between society and the environment.

The link between air pollution and premature deaths has been well established. A 30-year analysis of 652 cities in 24 countries and regions across six continents found that increases in air pollution were linked to increases in related deaths : The higher the levels of pollution, the faster people die.

While China has made some progress in tackling pollution, it still ranks poorly in global comparisons

The World Health Organization has estimated that around 7 million people die every year from exposure to fine particles in polluted air.

According to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the average number of ""good quality air days"" increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year in Hubei province, the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic.

Satellite images released by NASA and the European Space Agency also show a dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions -- those released by vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities -- in major Chinese cities between January and February.

China has already made significant progress in cleaning up its air in recent years. A study in 2019 found that pollution has declined significantly across China between 2013 and 2017. Beijing fell out of the top 100 most-polluted cities in Asia in recent years, with overall pollution levels 10% lower across Chinese cities between 2017 and 2018, according to a report by Greenpeace and AirVisual.

NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) pollution monitoring satellites have detected significant decreases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China. There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus.

Burke focused on the impact of lower concentrations of PM2.5 , the dangerous tiny particulate matter which can move deep into the lungs when inhaled and from there into the bloodstream.

Based on actual pollution data from four cities in China for 2016 to 2019, he calculated the reduction in pollution to be between 15 and 18 micrograms per cubic meter of air, or ug/m3.

To avoid overestimating the impact, Burke then rounded the reduction down to 10 ug/m3, and assumed only people living in urban areas would benefit from the cleaner air.

Burke was also able to tap into existing data showing the health benefits that cleaner air in China can have -- from the 2008 Beijing Olympics when Chinese authorities imposed strict pollution controls.

At that time NASA also observed a significant reduction in pollution levels.

Scientists analyzed the impact of these measures and found they dramatically reduced the number of premature deaths among children under five and adults over 70. The research suggested that monthly mortality of children under five increased 2.9% for every 1ug/m3 increase in PM2.5, and about 1.4% for people over 70 years old.

Based on those calculations, and considering a number of caveats, Burke calculated that the two months of cleaner air resulting from the coronavirus restrictions has saved the lives of between 1,400 and 4,000 children under 5, and 51,700 to 73,000 adults over 70 in China.

He said that while the cleaner air had likely saved lives, the broader disruption caused by Covid-19 could cause many additional deaths not directly attributable to being infected with the virus -- for example because of declines in economic well-being or the difficulty in accessing health services during the epidemic.

""Does this mean pandemics are good for health? No,"" he said. ""Instead it means that the way our economies operate absent pandemics has massive hidden health costs, and it takes a pandemic to help see that."""
China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak,['Analysis James Griffiths'],"Hong Kong (CNN) China's Communist Party wants more gratitude for its handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

It is necessary, Wang reportedly said , ""to carry out gratitude education among the citizens of the whole city, so that they thank (President Xi Jinping), thank the Chinese Communist Party, heed the party, walk with the party, and create strong positive energy.""

His comments attracted widespread criticism online , and have since been mostly scrubbed by the censors , though some state media reports including the quote remain accessible. Yet while Wang appears to have gone too far in the eyes of many -- creating a public relations headache the propaganda apparatus had to clean up -- the sentiment he was expressing is nevertheless widely shared.

As the coronavirus spreads around the world, China has been increasingly vocal about what it appears to feel is a lack of appreciation from the global community for its efforts to contain the outbreak, and preventing the crisis from being even worse than it may turn out to be.

The first cases of the virus were reported in Wuhan late last year, and since then China has borne the brunt of the outbreak, with almost three quarters of the more than 110,000 or so confirmed global cases in mainland China. More than 3,000 people have died due to the virus in China, with the majority in Hubei province. Hundreds of millions of people have also been placed under lockdown, while others have been unable to return to work due to travel restrictions.

Those containment efforts do appear to have been successful, with the number of new cases slowing to a trickle in recent weeks, as new outbreaks continued to emerge worldwide.

Underlining how much a corner has been turned in China, Xi himself arrived in Wuhan Tuesday for an inspection tour, his first since the outbreak began. While other senior officials have visited the city previously, it was thought that it was too risky for Xi to go himself until now, emphasizing how confident the government is that the outbreak is under control.

'A responsible country'

State media and top officials have begun pushing back hard on external criticism of Beijing's handling of the virus, both the seemingly flippant -- like Fox News host Jesse Watters demanding China apologize for the virus itself -- to the more substantial, such as widespread concerns over the government's apparent mishandling of the virus when it emerged in Wuhan

""In its efforts to fight off the epidemic, China has conducted itself as a responsible country,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said last week in response to the Watters video. ""China's signature strength, efficiency and speed in this fight has been widely acclaimed. To protect the health and safety of people across the world, the Chinese people have made huge sacrifice and major contributions.""

Zhao pointed to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , which ""broke out in the US"" (the first cases were actually in Mexico ) before spreading to hundreds of other countries, killing hundreds of thousands of people. ""I don't remember anyone asking the US to apologize,"" he said.

State broadcaster CGTN also linked coronavirus to the US swine flu outbreak, while Global Times, a state-backed tabloid, accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of attempting to ""pass the buck"" to China by criticizing Beijing's handling of the virus.

""As the chief US diplomat, Pompeo insisted on speaking of the 'Wuhan virus' despite the opposition of (the World Health Organization) and international public opinion, in an attempt to arouse resentment among those affected countries against China,"" the paper said in an editorial. ""Pompeo's move not only exposes malicious US intentions toward China without regard to common sense, but also hits a new low in his personal conduct.""

Pompeo told CNBC last week that it had been ""incredibly frustrating"" to work with the Chinese government to obtain data on the coronavirus, ""which will ultimately be the solution to both getting the vaccine and attacking this risk.""

He blamed the initial response to the virus -- during which Chinese officials appeared to downplay information about its severity -- as putting the US ""behind the curve"" in coming up with a response.

Controlling the narrative

The angry response to Fox News host Watters and Secretary of State Pompeo, as well as the expulsion last month of three Wall Street Journal reporters over the headline of an opinion piece about the virus, highlights Beijing's sensitivities over how it is perceived to be handling the outbreak.

Only a month ago, Beijing was dealing with widespread public anger over the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang . Li had attempted to warn university classmates about a new SARS-like virus spreading in Wuhan, only to be reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors."" He later died of the virus after contracting it while helping with relief efforts.

China's massive censorship and propaganda apparatus struggled to contain the reaction, and eventually several top Wuhan and Hubei officials were fired.

The public anger over Li's death and the authorities' response remains close to the surface, as the reaction to the comments made by Wang, the Wuhan party chief, showed (he eventually backtracked, thanking the ""heroic Wuhan people"" for their sacrifice Sunday). This week, the censors have again struggled to contain a story about another Wuhan doctor, who reportedly informed colleagues like Li about a spike in cases caused by a coronavirus.

An interview with Dr. Ai Fen in a prominent Chinese magazine was scrubbed shortly after publication, but on major Chinese social media platforms, users have reposted it over and again as censors try to delete it, including coming up with creative ways to display it in an attempt to avoid automatic deletion, such as writing the text backwards or vertically, or in braille or emojis. Some users described it as a ""relay race"" to try and stay one step ahead of the censors.

This shows the major challenge Beijing is facing over the coronavirus even as the caseload itself comes under control. By externalizing criticism, China's government may be able to further rally the country behind its leaders.

Given that sentiment in the US already appears hostile towards China, off the back of a drawn-out trade war and military rivalry, Beijing could also be worried about its initial mishandling of the outbreak becoming an election year issue.

And in setting out its line on where blame should lie, or not, China is potentially getting ahead of any future criticism as the virus spreads worldwide, killing hundreds more and sending global markets into a dangerous negative spiral.

The Chinese people have paid a tremendous cost in the past few months, that any gratitude owed by the world is to them, and not the government, is not something many officials seem willing to contemplate."
Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government,"['Analysis Nectar Gan', 'A User On Weibo']","Hong Kong (CNN) The word ""rumor"" has taken on a different meaning in China since the death of Li Wenliang , the doctor who was punished for trying to warn others about the spread of coronavirus.

Instead of doubtful hearsay, for many the word has come to suggest the inconvenient truths that authorities are trying to hide -- just like Li's attempt to expose a dangerous outbreak that has to date claimed more than 2,900 lives , including his own.

""Rumor is just a prophecy far ahead of our times,"" says a quote widely shared online in China in recent weeks.

The idea speaks to the mounting anger among many Chinese people over what they see as heavy-handed government censorship, with unpleasant truths written off as ""rumors"" and truth tellers threatened or faced with punishment.

On Chinese social media platforms, authorities have paid a price for silencing the truth. In many posts, if the warnings of Li and other medical workers had not been muzzled, they could have raised more awareness among the public and perhaps better prepared them for the deadly outbreak, which has now sickened over 84,000 people and placed hundreds of millions under varying forms of lockdown.

But the overwhelming narrative on social media is that concealing the truth has caused another problem. Amid dwindling public trust, authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to combat potentially harmful disinformation.

Doctor Li Wenliang, who was punished by police for ""rumor-mongering,"" was hailed as a hero by many in China for trying to blow the whistle on the coronavirus outbreak in late December.

Struggling with disinformation

Almost as soon as the outbreak spiraled into a public health crisis in late January, a dubious fringe theory started to spread: that the virus did not come from nature, but was man-made in a lab.

The conspiracy has been widely dismissed by scientists in China and the West, who point to research indicating that the virus is likely to have originated in bats and jumped to humans from an intermediate host -- just like its cousin that caused the SARS epidemic.

The scientific findings, however, did not prevent the rumor mill from spinning, nor did the repeated attempts by authorities to stamp out the wholly groundless accusations.

As the virus continued to spread and kill, conspiracy theories became more elaborate, with many pointing to a high-level virology lab known to study bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, the ground-zero of the outbreak.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology , an affiliate of the central government-run Chinese Academy of Sciences, runs the only lab on the Chinese mainland equipped for the highest level of biocontainment to research easily transmitted pathogens, such as coronaviruses.

the virus; in another version, a graduate student at the institute was the ""patient zero""; in an even more outlandish theory, that has since The common gist of various rumors lies with the suspicion that the novel coronavirus might have escaped from the lab. In one version, a researcher was bitten by the bat he was studying and became infected withthe virus; in another version, a graduate student at the institute was the ""patient zero""; in an even more outlandish theory, that has since been popularized overseas , the lab was covertly working for the Chinese military to make bioweapons, and the virus was unwittingly leaked in the process.

No credible evidence was offered for the theories, which originated from unverified social media accounts.

The rumors were so rife in China that a lead virologist on bat-related viruses at the lab took to social media on February 2 to declare that she ""guaranteed with her own life"" that the facility had nothing to do with the outbreak. But that too failed to quell the rumors. The institute followed up by issuing a statement two weeks later to denounce the accusations. But still suspicions persisted.

Four days later, the facility issued yet another all-encompassing statement that listed and rebutted all the rumors that had swirled around the lab in one sweep.

The rumors, which continue to proliferate, have since drawn the rebuke of scientists around the world.

""We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,"" wrote 27 prominent public health scientists in a joint statement published in the medical journal The Lancet on February 19.

Citing studies of the virus' genetic makeup, they said scientific findings ""overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.""

""Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumors, and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus,"" the scientists wrote.

Nevertheless, some in China remained unconvinced, posting on Weibo that they suspected a government cover-up

Separately, another unfounded theory taking aim at the US has gained traction among groups of Chinese nationalists.

was broadcast on state-run television, making it clear how rumormongers like him would be treated. But many Last month, a man in Inner Mongolia was detained for 10 days and fined 500 yuan ($71) for spreading the rumor that the coronavirus is a genetic weapon made by the US government. His detentionwas broadcast on state-run television, making it clear how rumormongers like him would be treated. But many remain undeterred , seeing his arrest as further proof of an alleged cover-up, while continuing to share and discuss the rumor online.

Another new, unfounded variation claims the coronavirus is not a man-made bioweapon, but did originate in the US -- and many Americans thought to have died of the flu this season were actually killed by COVID-19.

A Chinese man is seen in the side mirror of his scooter as he wears a protective mask while waiting at a red light in Beijing.

""What is the truth?""

While diehard conspiracy theorists can be found in every country, it's clear from social media that the plunge in public trust in the Chinese government following its alleged mishandling and censorship of the outbreak has made it much harder for authorities there to dispel rumors.

""What is the truth?"" wondered a user on Weibo on February 17, commenting on the Wuhan lab's attempt to end the rumors. ""The collapse of credibility of the government and the media is not only a woe for them, but also for us citizens.""

The erosion of trust is centered around cases such as Li, the Wuhan doctor, where so-called ""rumors"" were later deemed to be inconvenient truths authorities wanted to suppress.

Li was summoned by the Wuhan police on January 3 and reprimanded for ""spreading rumors,"" over a message he sent to his medical school alumni warning of the emergence of a SARS-like coronavirus. He later contracted the virus from a patient and died last month.

And Li was not alone. On January 1, Wuhan police announced they had ""taken legal measures"" against eight people for spreading rumors about the coronavirus. Chinese media later reported that some of them were also healthcare workers trying to sound the alarm, and several of them have come forward in the Chinese press to recount how they got into trouble for trying to warn colleagues and friends about the outbreak.

That deep-rooted frustration was summed up in a poignant joke that made the rounds on social media in late January, when the outbreak seemed to be spiraling out of control: ""If someone can go back in time to return to the Wuhan of a month ago, can they save us all from this catastrophe?"" ""Nope,"" the answer goes. ""They would just become the ninth rumor-monger.""

To the dismay and fury of many in China, the swift rebuttal of well-meaning ""rumors"" -- or in fact unpleasant truths -- did not stop with Li's death.

The whistle-blower's passing set off a remarkable storm of calls for free speech across the country. In response, the government has doubled down on its attempts to control the narrative.

Accounts and reports that fall outside the official line are promptly scrubbed from the internet and replaced with a constant flow of heroic tales of self-sacrifice. Independent voices describing the grim reality on the ground, meanwhile, have been silenced.

Chen Qiushi , a citizen journalist who documented the agony and heartbreak of residents in Wuhan, was forcefully quarantined by authorities last month, according to his friends.

Meanwhile, some propaganda attempts have backfired. In northwestern Gansu province, a state-run newspaper recently published a video of female medical workers having their heads shaved before setting off to join the front lines in Hubei, with some crying in front of the camera. The video, meant to show their admirable devotion, drew backlash online, with many questioning its necessity and whether the medics were pressured into shaving.

To be honest, it would be better if they don't dispel rumors. When I see a rumor refuted I would basically assume it is the truth. A user on Weibo

Over the past few weeks, Chinese social media has been alight with outrage at the propaganda and censorship, with the censors themselves having to work overtime to stay on top of it."
China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy,"['Ben Westcott', 'Shawn Deng']","Hong Kong (CNN) A strict ban on the consumption and farming of wild animals is being rolled out across China in the wake of the deadly coronavirus epidemic , which is believed to have started at a wildlife market in Wuhan.

Although it is unclear which animal transferred the virus to humans -- bat, snake and pangolin have all been suggested -- China has acknowledged it needs to bring its lucrative wildlife industry under control if it is to prevent another outbreak.

In late February, it slapped a temporary ban on all farming and consumption of ""terrestrial wildlife of important ecological, scientific and social value,"" which is expected to be signed into law later this year.

But ending the trade will be hard. The cultural roots of China's use of wild animals run deep, not just for food but also for traditional medicine, clothing, ornaments and even pets.

Thisisn't the first time Chinese officials have tried to contain the trade. In 2003, civets -- mongoose-type creatures -- were banned and culled in large numbers after it was discovered they likely transferred the SARS virus to humans. The selling of snakes was also briefly banned in Guangzhou after the SARS outbreak.

But today dishes using the animals are still eaten in parts of China.

Public health experts say the ban is an important first step, but are calling on Beijing to seize this crucial opportunity to close loopholes -- such as the use of wild animals in traditional Chinese medicine -- and begin to change cultural attitudes in China around consuming wildlife.

Markets with exotic animals

The Wuhan seafood market at the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak was selling a lot more than fish.

according to were filmed being slaughtered in the market in front of customers. CNN hasn't been able to independently verify the footage, which was posted to Weibo by a concerned citizen, and has since been deleted by government censors. Snakes, raccoon dogs, porcupines and deer were just some of the species crammed inside cages, side by side with shoppers and store owners,according to footage obtained by CNN. Some animalswere filmed being slaughtered in the market in front of customers. CNN hasn't been able to independently verify the footage, which was posted to Weibo by a concerned citizen, and has since been deleted by government censors.

It is somewhere in this mass of wildlife that scientists believe the novel coronavirus likely first spread to humans. The disease has now infected more than 94,000 people and killed more than 3,200 around the world.

The Wuhan market was not unusual. Across mainland China, hundreds of similar markets offer a wide range of exotic animals for a range of purposes.

The danger of an outbreak comes when many exotic animals from different environments are kept in close proximity.

""These animals have their own viruses,"" said Hong Kong University virologist professor Leo Poon. ""These viruses can jump from one species to another species, then that species may become an amplifier, which increases the amount of virus in the wet market substantially.""

When a large number of people visit markets selling these animals each day, Poon said the risk of the virus jumping to humans rises sharply.

Poon was one of the first scientists to decode the SARS coronavirus during the epidemic in 2003. It was linked to civet cats kept for food in a Guangzhou market, but Poon said researchers still wonder whether SARS was transmitted to the cats from another species.

""(Farmed civet cats) didn't have the virus, suggesting they acquired it in the markets from another animal,"" he said.

Picture taken in May 2003 shows a policeman watching over a civet cat captured in the wild by a farmer in Wuhan, central China's Hubei province.

Strength and status

Annie Huang, a 24-year-old college student from southern Guangxi province, said she and her family regularly visit restaurants that serve wild animals.

She said eating wildlife, such as boar and peacock, is considered good for your health, because diners also absorb the animals' physical strength and resilience.

Exotic animals can also be an important status symbol. ""Wild animals are expensive. If you treat somebody with wild animals, it will be considered that you're paying tribute,"" she said. A single peacock can cost as much as 800 yuan ($144).

Huang asked to use a pseudonym when speaking about the newly-illegal trade because of her views on eating wild animals.

She said she doubted the ban would be effective in the long run. ""The trade might lay low for a few months ... but after a while, probably in a few months, people would very possibly come back again,"" she said

Beijing hasn't released a full list of the wild animals included in the ban, but the current Wildlife Protection Law gives some clues as to what could be banned. That law classifies wolves, civet cats and partridges as wildlife, and states that authorities ""should take measures"" to protect them, with little information on specific restrictions.

The new ban makes exemptions for ""livestock,"" and in the wake of the ruling animals including pigeons and rabbits are being reclassified as livestock to allow their trade to continue.

Billion-dollar industry

Attempts to control the spread of diseases are also hindered by the fact that the industry for exotic animals in China, especially wild ones, is enormous.

A government-sponsored report in 2017 by the Chinese Academy of Engineering found the country's wildlife trade was worth more than $73 billion and employed more than one million people.

Since the virus hit in December, almost 20,000 wildlife farms across seven Chinese provinces have been shut down or put under quarantine, including breeders specializing in peacocks, foxes, deer and turtles, according to local government press releases.

It isn't clear what effect the ban might have on the industry's future -- but there are signs China's population may have already been turning away from eating wild animals even before the epidemic.

A study by Beijing Normal University and the China Wildlife Conservation Association in 2012, found that in China's major cities, a third of people had used wild animals in their lifetime for food, medicine or clothing -- only slightly less than in their previous survey in 2004.

However, the researchers also found that just over 52% of total respondents agreed that wildlife should not be consumed. It was even higher in Beijing, where more than 80% of residents were opposed to wildlife consumption.

In comparison, about 42% of total respondents were against the practice during the previous survey in 2004.

Since the coronavirus epidemic, there has been vocal criticism of the trade in exotic animals and calls for a crackdown. A group of 19 academics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and leading universities even jointly issued a public statement calling for an end to the trade, saying it should be treated as a ""public safety issue.""

""The vast majority of people within China react to the abuse of wildlife in the way people in other countries do -- with anger and revulsion,"" said Aron White, wildlife campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency.

""I think we should listen to those voices that are calling for change and support those voices.""

A vendor sells three peacocks at a wildlife animals market in Guangzhou, January 2004.

Traditional medicine loophole

A significant barrier to a total ban on the wildlife trade is the use of exotic animals in traditional Chinese medicine.

Beijing has been strongly promoting the use of traditional Chinese medicine under President Xi Jinping and the industry is now worth an estimated $130 billion.

As recently as October 2019, state-run media China Daily reported Xi as saying that ""traditional medicine is a treasure of Chinese civilization embodying the wisdom of the nation and its people.""

Many species that are eaten as food in parts of China are also used in the country's traditional medicine.

The new ban makes an exception made for wild animals used in traditional Chinese medicine. According to the ruling, the use of wildlife is not illegal for this, but now must be ""strictly monitored."" The announcement doesn't make it clear, however, how this monitoring will occur or what the penalties are for inadequate protection of wild animals, leaving the door open to abuse.

A 2014 study by the Beijing Normal University and the China Wildlife Conservation Association found that while deer is eaten as a meat, the animal's penis and blood are also used in medicine. Both bears and snakes are used for both food and medicine.

Wildlife campaigner Aron White said that under the new restrictions there was a risk of wildlife being sold or bred for medicine, but then trafficked for food. He said the Chinese government needed to avoid loopholes by extending the ban to all vulnerable wildlife, regardless of use.

""(Currently), the law bans the eating of pangolins but doesn't ban the use of their scales in traditional Chinese medicine,"" he said. ""The impact of that is that overall the consumers are receiving are mixed messages.""

The line between which animals are used for meat and which are used for medicine is also already very fine, because often people eat animals for perceived health benefits.

In a study published in International Health in February, US and Chinese researchers surveyed attitudes among rural citizens in China's southern provinces to eating wild animals.

One 40-year-old peasant farmer in Guangdong says eating bats can prevent cancer. Another man says they can improve your vitality.

""'I hurt my waist very seriously, it was painful, and I could not bear the air conditioner. One day, one of my friends made some snake soup and I had three bowls of it, and my waist obviously became better. Otherwise, I could not sit here for such a long time with you,"" a 67-year-old Guangdong farmer told interviewers in the study.

Changing the culture

China's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, will meet later this year to officially alter the Wildlife Protection Law. A spokesman for the body's Standing Committee said the current ban is just a temporary measure until the new wording in the law can be drafted and approved.

Hong Kong virologist Leo Poon said the government has a big decision to make on whether it officially ends the trade in wild animals in China or simply tries to find safer options.

""If this is part of Chinese culture, they still want to consume a particular exotic animal, then the country can decide to keep this culture, that's okay,"" he said.

""(But) then they have to come up with another policy -- how can we provide clean meat from that exotic animal to the public? Should it be domesticated? Should we do more checking or inspection? Implement some biosecurity measures?"" he said.

An outright ban could raise just as many questions and issues. Ecohealth Alliance president Peter Daszak said if the trade was quickly made illegal, it would push it out of wet markets in the cities, creating black markets in rural communities where it is easier to hide the animals from the authorities.

Driven underground, the illegal trade of wild animals for consumption and medicine could become even more dangerous.

""Then we'll see (virus) outbreaks begin not in markets this time, but in rural communities,"" Daszak said. ""(And) people won't talk to authorities because it is actually illegal.""

Poon said the final effectiveness of the ban may depend on the government's willpower to enforce the law. ""Culture cannot be changed overnight, it takes time,"" he said."
China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus,"['Laura He', 'Cnn Business']","Hong Kong (CNN Business) The novel coronavirus outbreak has been brutal for China and could plunge the country's economy into its first contraction since the 1970s.

Economic activity sharply declined across the board in February as companies struggled to reopen for business or hire workers during a government-mandated shutdown, according to official and private surveys released in recent days.

Wednesday revealed shockingly bad news for services in the world's second biggest economy. Chinese media group Caixin said its purchasing managers index for the sector plummeted to 26.5 last month from a reading of 51.8 the month before — the lowest figure recorded by the survey since it began in 2005. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, rather than growth.

""China's economy is in a very bad way indeed,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale.

That data — which mostly follows small and medium-sized companies — largely tracked with a government survey of primarily state-owned firms in the services sector released over the weekend. China's factories also recorded their worst month on record in February, according to government and Caixin data, as companies face extended closures to contain the virus, or struggled to fill jobs because of travel restrictions.

China and Japan's budding relationship in the time of coronavirus,"['Emiko Jozuka', 'Serenitie Wang']","Tokyo (CNN) ""Even though we live in different places, we live under the same sky,"" read the stanza on the sides of boxes filled with face masks and thermometers sent to China from the Japan Youth Development Association (JYDA).

Over 1,300 years ago, a grandson of the Japanese emperor sent that ancient poem to a high-ranking Chinese monk called Ganjin. It inspired him to go to Japan to spread Buddhism.

Just as it did then, the poem hit home today, going viral on Weibo with more than 39,000 posts tagging the line. Even former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama shared it with his Twitter followers.

The Japan Youth Association wanted to find a message that communicated their vision of bridging the divide between people when sending aid to China. They thought an ancient poem did that best.

As China battles the coronavirus outbreak that has so far killed more than2,700 people and infected over 80,000, Japan has proved to be something of an ally. Earlier this month, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang lauded Japan for supporting China.

By contrast, Geng accused the United States of overreacting and spreading fear by being the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan and imposing a travel ban on Chinese travelers.

The poem signified a thawing in relations between the old enemies that can be traced back to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's state visit to Beijing in 2018.

As Tokyo and Beijing stress that the state visit of Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Japan in April will not be canceled amid the coronavirus outbreak, a renewed focus is on how the world's second and third-largest economies could deepen ties.

Changing Chinese attitudes

Bitter territorial disputes and long-running grievances dating back to World War II have marred the Japan-China relationship for decades.

During WWII, the Japanese Imperial Army was responsible for a 1937 campaign of rape, murder and looting that became known as the Nanjing Massacre, in which an estimated 300,000 people died. Japanese air strikes during the war also inflicted severe damage on Chinese civilians in Chongqing, killing an estimated 32,000 people between February 1938 and August 1943.

China and Japan have often argued over how the past should be remembered.

Successive Japanese governments have apologized, with some prime ministers personally expressing regret for Japan's actions in the war , but many Chinese believe Japan has not adequately acknowledged the extent of its brutal occupation of the country during WWII.

Tensions flared in 2013, when the standoff over the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in the East China Sea inflamed nationalistic sentiment on both sides and impaired economic ties.

Back then, 92.8% of Chinese citizens surveyed had a negative impression of Japan, according to Japanese non-profit Genron, which conducts an annual poll on Japanese and Chinese relations.

As political relations improved, Chinese tourists starting booking trips to Japan and forming their own, positive views on Japanese culture, according to Yasushi Kudo, president of Genron. In 2018, 8.38 million Chinese visited Japan , up sixfold from 2013, according to Genron. Chinese consumers are also watching Japanese anime on video streaming platforms like Bilibili, which has roughly 37.6 million daily users , finding information on Japan on social media rather than on domestic news sites.

But while Chinese millennials with greater purchasing power are traveling more, the same can't be said of Japan, said Kudo. As the Japanese economy shrinks and millennials face issues such as the aging population and static salaries, there is less desire to explore the world, according to Kudo.

""You create an impression of another country by going there and making friends, but Japanese people aren't going to China that much, so they're forming their opinions based off of Japanese media reports,"" said Kudo.

""Our region flourished as an international sight-seeing region because of our Asian friends,"" said Kato.

By February 18 , Japan's private sector had donated over 3 million masks as well as 43.96 million yuan ($6.3 million) in monetary donations.

On a state level, things have been improving, too.

A 'marriage of convenience'

Nothing brings together two old foes like a common problem.

That was the case in May 2018, when Xi and Abe held telephone talks in a historic first to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. A few months later, Abe became the first Japanese leader in nearly seven years to visit China when he made a state visit to Beijing.

Then, China and Japan held their first forum geared to strengthen their collaborations in third-party countries such as Thailand, which has friendly diplomatic relations with both Beijing and Tokyo. By the end, both countries had inked agreements worth $18 billion

More recently, the rapprochement between China and Japan has had a lot to do with Trump's declaration of a trade war on China and Japan, according to Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University.

""Before Trump's arrival, Xi and Abe didn't have such a good relationship, now their relations are more a marriage of convenience in face of the common threat,"" said Nakano.

But while Abe's support for China as it battles the coronavirus outbreak may have won him some mileage with Xi, it has sparked anger among his hawkish supporters at home, as Japan steps up efforts to contain its own outbreak.

""The Japanese government has taken relative soft stance when it comes to blocking the flow of people from China to Japan compared to some other countries,"" said Nakano. ""Some of Abe's supporters were angry about that as they thought he prioritized his new friendship with Xi over national security.""

Focusing on the positives

Despite this recent uptick in relations, fundamentally, Japan and China have rivaling visions for the future of the Asia-Pacific region and the role of China within it. Issues over territory have not gone away, but merely been placed on the back burner.

""The political elites have spent the decades vilifying either side to rally their troops behind the leaders, it would be naive to think that trend would change now,"" Nakano said.

Over the past few years, China has bolstered its naval powers in the South China Sea at a speed unmatched by any nation. In response, Japan announced in 2019 that it would allocate more resources to defend its territory from possible Chinese incursion.

While Japan needs to do business with China, it's not willing to sacrifice the umbrella of US military protection, and has already built up other allegiances across the region to counter a rising China, said Jeff Kingston, a Japan expert at Temple University.

""For now, both sides see an advantage in dialing down tensions. Some of the permafrost has thawed but there are still deep layers of frost -- and that's not just about territory, there is also historical differences,"" he said.

Compared to a century ago, China and Japan are now both highly modernized, globally significant economies, meaning any potential downturn in their relations could have serious ramifications globally.

With a looming global economic slump and racist coronavirus-related assaults and slurs spreading faster than the outbreak, for now, China and Japan appear to be focusing on what they share in common and what benefits both parties.

""The recent outbreak has been a stress-test for bilateral relations, so taking what is anxiety-inducing and turning it around was clever,"" said Kingston. ""That poem is trying to get people to listen to the better part of themselves."""
Coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic',"['Analysis Charles Riley', 'Cnn Business', 'Diane Swonk', 'Chief Economist At Grant Thornton']","London (CNN Business) The emergence of hundreds of coronavirus cases in two major economies outside China has dashed hopes of a speedy recovery from an epidemic that has already wreaked havoc on global supply chains and hit company profits .

The number of infections in South Korea, a major producer of cars, electronics and machinery, has shot up to more than 890. Italy, which started the weekend with a handful of cases, now has over 270 and seven confirmed deaths. Officials have shut down public buildings, schools and sports events in some parts of the country's industrial north.

With Japan already reporting hundreds of infections, four of the world's top 12 economies — representing about27% of global GDP — are now scrambling to contain the virus. A fifth — Germany — is teetering on the brink of recession

The spike in cases outside China signals a new phase in the battle against coronavirus, greater risk for companies and their workers, and global economic growth.

It may not be called a health pandemic yet but it is an economic pandemic.""

Officials and business leaders had been hoping that dramatic action taken by China would slow the spread of coronavirus and prevent it from gaining traction around the world.

If China's factories were able to restart production quickly after an extended shutdown, the world's second largest economy would have a chance to return to normal in the second quarter.

Under that scenario, global growth this year would only be 0.1 percentage points weaker than expected, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said over the weekend. The IMF boss cautioned, however, that she was also looking at ""more dire scenarios"" where the outbreak turns out to be ""more persistent and widespread.""

Economic damage

Stock markets, which had so far largely brushed off the threat from coronavirus, are now reflecting the growing risk of a much bigger hit to the global economy.

The sharp increase in infections in Italy and South Korea, the world's eighth and twelfth largest economies, produced a sharp reaction from investors. South Korea's benchmark share index closed down nearly 3.9% on Monday, its worst day since October 2018. In Italy, the main market index closed down more than 5%. The Dow lost 1,031 points, or 3.6%, its worst day in two years.

Reduced demand for goods and services, and factory closures in China, were already expected to slam Chinese growth in the first quarter, weigh on trade and slow global growth. But the spread of the virus increases the risk of substantial damage to economies that were growing at a much slower place than China — or, as in the cases of Germany, Italy and Japan, already at risk of recession.

""When the virus was limited to China and other nearby countries, it was viewed as an economic issue for Asia,"" said Kevin Giddis, chief fixed income strategist at Raymond James. ""The spread of the virus into Italy now makes this a European issue and possibly a global issue that could upset the supply chain for months or years to come.""

Italy's economy contracted by 0.3% in the final three months of 2019, compared to the previous quarter, and some economists were expecting the country to fall into recession early this year before the coronavirus outbreak escalated.

Fiat Chrysler FCAU The bulk of cases in Italy are in the northern region of Lombardy, whose capital is the financial center of Milan. Turin, which is home to, is located to the west of Milan, while other carmakers including Ferrari are situated to its southeast. Milan is also home to many luxury goods makers, and the city just hosted its annual fashion week.

Officials have yet to track down the first carrier of the virus in Italy. Restrictions designed to stop the spread of coronavirus in the country affect about 100,000 people.

The coronavirus is also hiking the risk of recession in other countries. The economy of Japan, which has reported 840 cases, including 691 from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, shrank 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the country was slammed by a sales tax hike and a powerful typhoon. Another quarter of contraction will put the world's third biggest economy into recession.

Germany, the biggest economy in Europe and number four in the world, ground to a halt right before the coronavirus outbreak set in, dragged down by the country's struggling factories. German companies rely on China to buy cars and other products, and economists at Berenberg bank said Monday they now expect the economy to contract in the first quarter of 2020. Official data published Tuesday confirmed GDP did not grow in the final three months of 2019.

A worker sprays disinfectant to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Seoul.

South Korea is also in a vulnerable position.

Exports to China, its largest market, were positive in December for the first time in 14 months. But research firm Oxford Economics expects both exports and industrial production to suffer because of the outbreak in China.

Hyundai HYMTF It warned that South Korean electronics, autos and electrical equipment makers could struggle to get the parts they need from China to keep their factories running.has already been forced to stop production at plants in South Korea because of parts shortages.

And because people are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick, consumer demand could suffer in South Korea. President Moon Jae-in said the country was at a ""watershed moment"" Sunday, as he issued the highest level of national alert and ordered new resources to tackle the outbreak.

A global issue

Apple AAPL A slew of companies includinghave warned that the coronavirus will prevent them from meeting sales or profit targets for the first three months of the year. But many of the financial projections assumed the coronavirus would be contained to China.

The International Air Transport Association, fogr example, warned last week that coronavirus could cost global carriers nearly $30 billion in lost revenue. Global demand would drop by 4.7%, the first decline since the financial crisis.

The group's estimate was based, however, on the disruption caused by SARS when it ripped through China in 2003. That virus caused real economic damage over a period of months, including for airlines, but the sharp decline in activity was ""followed by an equally quick recovery,"" according to IATA.

""We don't yet know exactly how the [current] outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not,"" IATA warned.

The continued spread of the novel coronavirus makes the SARS comparison increasingly tenuous.

Major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis, and global debt levels have never been higher. Those factors could limit the response by policymakers around the world.

Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Monday on Twitter that there is a growing consensus among economists that the US Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next month, in response to the coronavirus.

""It may not be called a health pandemic yet but it is an economic pandemic,"" she said."
Trump again defends use of the term 'China virus',"['Maegan Vazquez', 'Betsy Klein']","(CNN) President Donald Trump was pressed for the second straight day on why he is calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus,"" amid instances of bigotry against Asian Americans.

After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing.

Trump claimed that he is using the term because China tried to blame the virus on US soldiers.

"" 'Cause it comes from China. It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate,"" Trump said on Wednesday.

Pressed again, he said: ""I have great love for all of the people from our country, but as you know China tried to say at one point ... that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. It's not gonna happen, not as long as I'm President. It comes from China.""

Coronavirus: Is drinking cow urine any help?,"['Reality Check Team', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A cow-urine drinking event in Delhi

India has had relatively few confirmed cases of coronavirus - but there's been plenty of misleading advice on how to tackle it.

BBC News been fact-checking some of the most prominent examples.

Cow urine and dung

There is a long tradition in India of promoting cow urine and dung as traditional remedies for various diseases.

And an MP from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Suman Haripriya, has suggested they could be used against the coronavirus.

Facebook Cow dung has many benefits. I think it can kill the coronavirus. Cow urine can also be useful.

There have been previous studies into the potential anti-bacterial properties of cow urine.

And a Hindu nationalist group has held a cow-urine drinking event in the capital, Delhi, to promote its use for tackling the virus.

But Dr Shailendra Saxena, of the Indian Virological Society, told BBC News: ""There is no medical evidence to show that cow urine has anti-viral characteristics.

""Moreover, using cow-dung could prove counter-productive as bovine faecal matter could contain a coronavirus which might replicate in humans.""

Alcohol-free hand sanitiser

As well as cow-dung soap, Cowpathy has been selling alcohol-free hand sanitiser with ""distilled cow urine obtained from indigenous cows"" online since 2018.

Currently out of stock, the product page says: ""Due to high demand, we are currently limiting the purchase quantity per customer for this product to maximize access for our customers.""

Meanwhile, Ramdev, a yoga guru on a popular Hindi news channel, has suggested making herbal hand sanitisers at home.

He also said consuming a concoction of ayurvedic herb giloy, turmeric and basil leaves could help prevent coronavirus.

But the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say it is important to use alcohol-based hand sanitisers.

And Prof Sally Bloomfield, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says any homemade hand sanitiser will be ineffective as even vodka contains only 40% alcohol.

Vegetarianism

Last week, Anil Vij, the Health Minister of Haryana state, in northern India, made an appeal for people not to eat meat.

""Be vegetarian,"" he tweeted.

""Do not create viruses like coronavirus, which pose a danger to humanity, by having [meat of] different kinds of animals.""

A Hindu nationalist group, meanwhile, claimed the coronavirus had come to punish meat-eaters.

But after the ministry that oversees livestock production said it had led to a fall in the sales of eggs and chicken, the Indian government's fact-checking service posted a rebuttal of the claim.

And government minister Giriraj Singh said the Indian food regulator had found no evidence for it.

How to stay happy in troubling times,['William Park'],"With the unfolding global coronavirus pandemic leading to people being confined to their homes, borders being shut and economic instability, it can be hard not to feel overwhelmed by the state of the world at the moment. The good news? Even in times of stress and anxiety, you can take proactive steps to lift your mood.

The science of emotions is incredibly complicated, but it is also well-studied. Over the years, BBC Future has interviewed dozens of world-leading experts in psychology who shared with us practical, everyday tips for coping better with stress. We recently trawled through the research. Here are some of the top tips we found – some of which may surprise you.

1. Distract yourself.

It’s easy to run over and over the topic that’s stressing us out, whether that’s the new coronavirus outbreak, the state of the climate or something else. But stopping people from ruminating on a recent stressful event – by offering a distraction – can lower their blood pressure back to normal levels quicker than offering no distraction.

2. If you meditate, be aware that it might not work for everyone.

In times like these, many people might find meditation and mindfulness helpful. But others might not – for precisely the reason above. For some people, practicing stillness might simply invite rumination. It can be difficult not to think about stressful events when trying to clear our minds. This may be why evidence for the benefits of mindfulness and meditation is patchy. For those people, a more compelling distraction than meditation might be required.

3. Reframe the situation.

How we interpret our emotions is largely down to how they’re framed – in other words, the context. While talking about his 2017 book Happy, Derren Brown gives the example of a tennis player going into a match thinking “I must win”. If they set an expectation that winning is everything, if they start to lose, they feel like an abject failure. This is a trap perfectionists tend to fall into, and it’s why perfectionists tend to respond with more guilt, shame and anger when they feel they aren’t succeeding. They may even be more likely to give up.

The player who goes into a match thinking “I will play the best I can”, however, believes that they are less hurt by losing, so long as they are doing their best. The signs of failure are interpreted differently by both players based on the expectations that they set for themselves.

It’s worth thinking about how you can apply this in your daily life: can each moment or day be about doing the best you can in a stressful situation (“I will practice proper hygiene and social distancing”), rather than focusing on an outcome out of your control (“I will not and cannot get sick”)?

That control part is key. Stressful situations are often beyond our control, and we create anxiety and worry when we try to control what we can’t. Focusing on what can be controlled, on the other hand, can decrease feelings of anxiety.

4. Don’t obsess over being positive or happy.

This one may seem counterintuitive: it can be a bad idea to chase positive emotions. Actively pursuing happiness can lead to the reverse effect. For one thing, the more we focus on our own happiness, the less we focus on the happiness of the people around us, which has been shown to contribute to feelings of isolation and disconnection. There is also a link between searching for happiness and feeling that time is slipping away.

And again, if you’re focused on an outcome like “I must feel happy”, you may feel worse about yourself if you don’t succeed – even though it’s perfectly natural to have a more difficult time feeling happy in stressful times."

Coronavirus: Asian nations face second wave of imported cases,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It comes as these countries had been successful in controlling its domestic cases

South Korea, China and Singapore are among the Asian countries facing a second coronavirus wave, spurred by people importing it from outside.

China, where the virus first emerged, confirmed it had no new domestic cases on Wednesday, for the first time since the outbreak began, a major milestone.

But it reported 34 new cases among people recently returned to China.

Singapore also reported 47 new cases, of which 33 were imported - 30 of them returned Singapore residents.

South Korea saw a jump in new cases on Thursday with 152, though it is not clear how many were imported.

A new cluster there is centred on a nursing home in Daegu, where 74 patients have tested positive.

Japan reported three new cases on Wednesday. But Hokkaido, the worst-affected Japanese region with 154 cases, is lifting its state of emergency in place since late February, after officials said the spread of the virus appeared to be ending.

Officials have urged people to remain cautious and stay at home, but said there had been ""no surge of infected patients that led to the collapse of the medical environment"".

""We've carried out powerful measures on refraining from going out, but from now on, we will move into a stage of reducing risks of the spread of infection while maintaining social and economic activities,"" governor Naomichi Suzuki said on Wednesday.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) reported no domestically transmitted cases in China for the first time since the virus emerged in late December.

It also said there were no cases at all in Wuhan, the outbreak centre which was essentially locked down earlier this year, but 34 cases arriving from abroad.

China's death toll stands at 3,245, however there have been ongoing questions over the reliability of China's data.

All four countries had all been showing success in controlling domestic cases, but there is concern that increases elsewhere could unravel their progress.

South Korea has been praised for its response to the epidemic, which has involved tracing the infection, testing large amounts of people and isolating patients quickly.

The pace of daily new infections has slowed since the outbreak peaked earlier this month. Before Wednesday's increase, the number of people contracting the virus had been in double digits for the last four days.

Health officials have warned there is no room for complacency and are once again urging the public to stay away from large gatherings including in churches, nursing homes, internet cafes and karaoke rooms.

Three people from the national fencing team have tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a competition in Hungary. All 26 athletes and coaches are now being tested.

It is as if the lights have been switched off. The global economy has been plunged into darkness as countries hunker down in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Most recessions develop gradually over time. When the last one started in 2008 it took the Bank of England six months to spot it. This time it is different. Then it was a financial virus, this time it is the real thing. Commentators often say the economy is hitting the wall or is falling off a cliff on the weakest of evidence. Today the cliches are horrifyingly true.

On some estimates the UK economy is on course to shrink by 15% in the second quarter of 2020. That is not a recession, it is a collapse surpassing anything in modern times, including the Great Depression.

When the banks were bailed out in 2008, it was because policymakers feared precisely what is now happening: a complete shutdown of the global economy. The rescue package worked, but only just. The early indications from China are that the impact of Covid-19 is markedly greater than that of the financial crisis, itself the most severe downturn of the postwar era."
London tube to close many stations because of coronavirus,['Kevin Rawlinson'],"Waterloo and City line will stop running, up to 40 other stations will shut down, and overnight tube services will be suspended

Dozens of London Underground stations are to be closed indefinitely amid a toughening of measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus.

Transport for London (TfL) announced a series of changes late on Wednesday evening as it urged people in the capital not to travel if at all possible.

“People should not be travelling, by any means, unless they really, really have to,” said the mayor, Sadiq Khan. “Londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary and that means they should be avoiding using the transport network unless absolutely necessary.”

As part of the measures, TfL said up to 40 tube stations that have no interchange, including St James’s Park, Hyde Park Corner and Covent Garden face being closed from Thursday onwards. The closures would be in effect for the foreseeable future.

It said the Waterloo and City line, which serves the capital’s financial district, would close altogether from Friday 20 March and that the 24-hour Friday and Saturday night tube service, as well as night Overground trains, would cease to operate from this weekend. Transport bosses said late services on each would still run but were intended for essential travel only.

TfL said it planned to gradually reduce the capacity across the network fromnext Monday as it sought to focus on providing a service for critical workers. That included London buses, which TfL would begin to operate a “service similar to a Saturday”.

Khan added: “London will get through these extraordinarily challenging times and ensuring the capital’s critical workers can move around the city will be crucial. Frontline staff across our health and care service – as well as those ensuring Londoners stay safe and can access food and other essentials – should be commended for their hard work. We owe it to them to do whatever we can to help them do their jobs effectively.

“I’m urging Londoners to only use public transport for essential journeys. Everyone should follow this and the other advice to help keep themselves and each other safe.”

London’s transport commissioner, Mike Brown, said: “The advice from government is clear: people should now only be making journeys that are absolutely essential. We and our staff are doing everything we can to ensure that people who need to make essential journeys can continue to do so.

“Everyone should follow the advice of Public Health England to ensure they are doing everything they can to stay safe and limit the spread of the virus.”

'A generation has died': Italian province struggles to bury its coronavirus dead,"['Angela Giuffrida', 'Lorenzo Tondo']","Coffins awaiting burial are lining up in churches and the corpses of those who died at home are being kept in sealed-off rooms for days as funeral services struggle to cope in Bergamo, the Italian province hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

As of Wednesday, Covid-19 had killed 2,978 across Italy, all buried or cremated without ceremony. Those who die in hospital do so alone, with their belongings left in bags beside coffins before being collected by funeral workers.

In Bergamo, a province of 1.2 million people in the Lombardy region, where 1,640 of the total deaths in the country have taken place, 3,993 people had contracted the virus by Tuesday. The death toll across the province is unclear, but CFB, the area’s largest funeral director, has carried out almost 600 burials or cremations since 1 March.

“In a normal month we would do about 120,” said Antonio Ricciardi, the president of CFB. “A generation has died in just over two weeks. We’ve never seen anything like this and it just makes you cry.”

There are about 80 funeral companies across Bergamo, each receiving dozens of calls an hour. A shortage of coffins as providers struggle to keep up with demand and funeral workers becoming infected with the virus are also hampering preparations.

Hospitals have adopted more stringent rules regarding the handling of the dead, who need to be placed in a coffin straight away without being clothed due to the risk of infection posed by their bodies. “Families can’t see their loved ones or give them a proper funeral, this is a big problem on a psychological level,” said Ricciardi. “But also because many of our staff are ill, we don’t have as many people to transport and prepare the bodies.”

For those who die at home, the bureaucratic process is lengthier as deaths need to be certified by two doctors. The second is a specialist who would ordinarily have to certify the death no later than 30 hours after a person has passed away.

“So you have to wait for both doctors to come and at this time, many of them are also ill,” added Ricciardi.

Stella, a teacher in Bergamo, shared the story of one of the deceased with the Guardian. “Yesterday, an 88-year-old man died,” she said. “He’d had a fever for a few days. There was no way to call an ambulance because the line was always busy. He died alone in his room. The ambulance arrived an hour later. Obviously, nothing could be done. And since no coffins were available in Bergamo, they left him on the bed and sealed his room to keep his relatives from entering until a coffin could be found.”

Adding to the torment is the fact that relatives cannot visit their loved ones in hospital, or give them proper funerals.

“Usually you would be able to dress them and they would stay one night in the family home. None of this is happening,” said Alessandro, whose 74-year-old uncle died in Codogno, the Lombardy town where the outbreak began. “You can’t even see them to say goodbye, this is the most devastating part.”

The harrowing impact of the virus on Bergamo can be gleaned from the obituary section of the local newspaper L’Eco di Bergamo. On Friday, reader Giovanni Locatelli shared online footage comparing the newspaper’s obituary section on 9 February, when listings took up just one page, to a copy dated 13 March, when 10 pages were needed to commemorate the dead. On Sunday, Il Messaggero posted a video of coffins lined up in a church.

“We have asked for support from funeral companies nationally as deaths have risen exponentially,” said Pietro Bonaldi, the director of Lia, a business association in Bergamo. “We have reached capacity. And unfortunately, in recent days a lot of funeral workers have become sick with the virus and so can’t work.”

Elsewhere in Italy, there have been cases of funeral companies refusing to take bodies, for example in Naples, where the body of Teresa Franzese, 47, was kept at home for almost two days before it was collected.

All religious ceremonies, including funerals, masses and weddings, are banned amid the lockdown. However, two priests, one near Venice and another in the southern Campania region, were charged for officiating a funeral."
Scientists say mass tests in Italian town have halted Covid-19 there,['Lorenzo Tondo'],"A study in Vò, which saw Italy’s first death, points to the danger of asymptomatic carriers

The small town of Vò, in northern Italy, where the first coronavirus death occurred in the country, has become a case study that demonstrates how scientists might neutralise the spread of Covid-19.

A scientific study, rolled out by the University of Padua, with the help of the Veneto Region and the Red Cross, consisted of testing all 3,300 inhabitants of the town, including asymptomatic people. The goal was to study the natural history of the virus, the transmission dynamics and the categories at risk.

The researchers explained they had tested the inhabitants twice and that the study led to the discovery of the decisive role in the spread of the coronavirus epidemic of asymptomatic people.

When the study began, on 6 March, there were at least 90 infected in Vò. For days now, there have been no new cases.

“We were able to contain the outbreak here, because we identified and eliminated the ‘submerged’ infections and isolated them,” Andrea Crisanti, an infections expert at Imperial College London, who took part in the Vò project, told the Financial Times. “That is what makes the difference.”

The research allowed for the identification of at least six asymptomatic people who tested positive for Covid-19. ‘‘If these people had not been discovered,” said the researchers, they would probably have unknowingly infected other inhabitants.

“The percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high,” wrote Sergio Romagnani, professor of clinical immunology at the University of Florence, in a letter to the authorities. “The isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease.”

There are many experts and mayors in Italy who push to carry out mass tests in the country, including asymptomatic ones.

“A test does no harm to anyone,” said the governor of the Veneto region Luca Zaia, who is taking action to test every single inhabitant of the region.” Zaia, described Vò as, ‘‘the healthiest place in Italy’’. ‘‘This is proof that the testing system works,’’ he added.

“Here there were the first two cases. We tested everyone, even if the ‘experts’ told us this was a mistake: 3,000 tests. We found 66 positives, who we isolated for 14 days, and after that 6 of them were still positive. And that is how we ended it.’’

However, according to some, the problems of mass tests are not only of an economic nature (each swab costs about 15 euros) but also at a organisational level.

On Tuesday, the WHO representative, Ranieri Guerra, said: “Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged the identification and diagnosis of suspected cases and symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases to be increased, as much as possible. At the moment, the recommendation to carry out mass screening has not been suggested.”

Massimo Galli, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Milan and director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, warned carrying out mass tests on the asymptomatic population could however prove to be useless.

“The contagions are unfortunately constantly evolving,” Galli told the Guardian. “A man who tests negative today could contract the disease tomorrow.”"
Coronavirus latest: at a glance,['Alison Rourke'],"Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:

Australia and New Zealand close borders

Australia has closed its borders to all but citizens and residents from 9pm on Friday. No end date for the measure was given. The country’s central bank also cut interest rates to a the historically low figure of 0.25%, and announced a major financial stimulus package. The airline Qantas stood down two thirds of its workforce. New Zealand’s border will be closed to all but citizens and residents from Thursday night. The move is unprecedented in both countries.

China’s Hubei province records no new cases for first time

China reported 34 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, but for the first time, none were in Hubei province – the centre of the outbreak. All 34 were so-called “imported cases” , of people who had returned to the China with infections. Chinese state media listed Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the UK as the top four places people had returned from during the outbreak.

Donald Trump signs coronavirus bill ordering free virus testing

US legislation that will expand Medicaid and unemployment benefits, mandate paid sick leave and childcare leave for certain employees, and order free coronavirus testing, has been passed in an effort to to limit the damage from the pandemic. Infections in the US passed 9,400.

London closes dozens of tube stations

Dozens of London Underground stations are to be closed indefinitely amid a toughening of measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus. Transport for London announced a series of changes late on Wednesday evening as it urged people in the capital not to travel if at all possible. “People should not be travelling, by any means, unless they really, really have to,” said the mayor, Sadiq Khan. On Wednesday the UK announced the closure of all schools, the first in its modern history.

Iran to pardon 10,000 prisoners

Tehran plans to pardon 10,000 prisoners, including political ones, in honour of the Iranian new year on Friday. It was not stated whether the pardons would include the British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe – who was released on Tuesday for two weeks, when 85,000 were let out temporarily because of coronavirus – or the British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who was not known to have been released.

Italy’s death toll approaches China’s

Nearly 3,000 people have died in Italy from Covid-19, a figure that is rapidly approaching China’s death toll of 3,245. The sheer number of cases and fatalities has overwhelmed the funeral industry, where coffins awaiting burial are lined up in churches and the corpses of those who died at home are being kept in sealed-off rooms for days.

South Korea launches stimulus package

South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, on Thursday pledged $39 billion) in emergency financing for small businesses along with other stimulus measures to help shore up its economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus crisis.

Japan’s deputy prime minister says Olympics are ‘cursed’

Taro Aso, who has a history of making gaffes, has described the Tokyo Olympics as “cursed”, as speculation over postponing the event due to the outbreak mounted. The nation’s northernmost island of Hokkaido has lifted its state of emergency, less than three weeks after its governor, Naomichi Suzuki, asked residents to remain indoors after a spike in the number of local cases of the virus.

Foreigners stranded in Panama

Between 400 and 500 foreigners are stranded in Panama after a “tribal” festival and music event ended with many of them being quarantined at the concert site near the Caribbean beach of Playa Chiquita, an organiser said Wednesday.

Markets continue to fall as governments take action

South Korea prepared crisis funds to put a floor under crashing bond and stock markets on Thursday as the coronavirus pandemic led to heavy sales of riskier assets worldwide and a scramble in emerging markets for the safety of US dollars. On Thursday, Korea’s Kospi fell nearly 9%; India’s currency hit a record low (and its central bank has pledged to buy a huge amount of bonds on Friday); the Philippines stock market slumped as much as 24% at one point and has lost more than a third of its value this year; Australia’s market fell by 3.4%; Japan’s Nikkei was down 1%."
Coronavirus: why are UK schools closing and what does it mean for parents?,['Sally Weale'],"Why are schools closing now?

Up until Wednesday the British government’s policy had been to keep schools open, not least to ensure that key NHS and frontline care workers can remain in their posts rather than going home to look after their children. But Boris Johnson said the government had been forced to change tack because the rate of Covid-19 infections was increasing faster than anticipated. He said the public health benefits of keeping schools open had shifted and the scientific advice was that schools should close to slow the spread of the virus. But by the time the announcement was made, many schools had already been forced to close because of staff shortages due to illness or self-isolation measures.

What does it mean for parents?

When schools close on Friday, many parents will have little choice but to take time off work to look after their children at home. The measures apply to state and private schools alike, nurseries and sixth-form colleges. The advice is to not ask grandparents to help with childcare, because of their vulnerability to the virus. Schools have been drawing up homework packs and online resources to help parents home educate. Without being able to provide immediate details, the government said it plans to provide a skeletal school service for parents who are key workers on the frontline of the national effort to stem the pandemic – including doctors, nurses, and food delivery workers – so they can stay at work. Vulnerable children, those who have a social worker, and pupils entitled to special needs support will also be able to stay in school. Where possible special schools and residential schools will continue to look after children and young people.

Is it safe to send my child to school if I am a key worker?

The government has emphasised throughout that children do not appear to be severely affected by the virus, and with only small numbers of pupils and staff attending school in the coming weeks and months the risk of transmission will be much reduced. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has stressed that schools are not dangerous for children and the decision to close now is to “knock down” transmission and delay the progress of the virus.

What if only one parent is a key worker?

If one parent is a key worker, the government will expect the other parent to have their child at home. Single parents who are key workers will obviously be entitled to a school place.

What about the summer exams?

GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled and it’s not clear exactly what will replace them. In England, almost all qualifications are now assessed by end of course exams so there is no continuous assessment to rely on. However, teachers ordinarily provide predicted A-level grades for students applying to university, and GCSE students have already sat mock exams which will have given their teachers some idea of their pupils’ likely results. The education secretary was at pains to reassure pupils and their families that every child would get “the proper recognition” they deserve. “We’re working very closely with Ofqual to have a detailed set of measures that make sure no child is unfairly penalised,” he said.

Is there any special provision for children eligible for free school meals?

Emergency plans are being drawn up to try to ensure that vulnerable children who are entitled to free school meals do not go hungry when schools close. The government is planning a voucher scheme to make up for free school meals.

Where possible schools will be encouraged to keep their kitchens open to cook hot meals and act as a food distribution hub for children in need, while elsewhere headteachers are making supermarket vouchers available to try to ease the burden on the most vulnerable families. More than a million children in England who come from the most disadvantaged families currently benefit from a free school lunch. For many it may be the only hot meal of the day they enjoy and experts say it is vital that children continue to benefit, despite the closures which could last for a long time.

How long are schools likely be closed?

At this stage no-one is able to say exactly how long schools will stay closed, though it seems clear it’s more likely to be a matter of months rather than weeks, depending on how the pandemic progresses. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs he would be “guided by scientific and medical advice” on reopening. In practice they could remain closed until the start of the next school year in September.

What will children be able to do while they are off school?

The government is keen to encourage as much educational activity at home as is feasible, but parents are going to have be creative – and very patient. As well as homework materials provided by individual schools, the government is working with the BBC to develop resources to keep children occupied and stimulated and many e-learning platforms are offering their resources free of charge.

With cinemas, museums, theatres and libraries closed, all normal entertainment is ruled out. Like everyone else, children will be subject to the same social-distancing rules which mean travel and outings are curtailed and most activities will have to be home-based. One of the challenges will be to keep children physically active with group sporting activities and space confined."
Covid-19: how effective is social distancing?,"['Ian Sample', 'Max Sanderson']","Ian Sample speaks to Prof Deirdre Hollingsworth about social distancing. What is it? How might it help to flatten the curve? And what are some of the big unknowns when it comes to predicting how effective it might be?

Children and coronavirus: what we know and don't know,['Jessica Glenza'],"The health effects of the Covid-19 outbreak have generally been milder on children but many unknowns remain

As the number of Covid-19 cases rises worldwide, parents trying to protect their children from the disease can take solace in one thing: the disease has generally been milder in children.

However, there are many unknowns about coronavirus, and research is ongoing. Here is what we know now.

Can children catch coronavirus?

Yes. They can be infected with and appear to be able to transmit coronavirus, even if they do not have symptoms. That is why it is important for children to practice social distancing and hand-washing, even if they do not appear ill.

How does coronavirus affect children?

It is generally believed to cause milder symptoms in children, but the specific impacts by age are becoming clearer as the outbreak goes on.

Much of what we know today is based on reports out of China, where the outbreak began. There 2.4% of all identified cases were in children under 19 years old. An even smaller number within this group of children had severe symptoms, 2.5%, or what the World Health Organization (WHO) described as “a very small proportion”. But more research is being done and a clearer picture is still emerging.

Why does coronavirus affect children differently?

That remains unknown. Dr Jay C Butler, deputy director of infectious disease at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, “The phenomenon is very significant,” on a live-streamed show hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, but that the mechanisms are “really unknown”.

People aged 60 and older or with existing health conditions remain the most vulnerable to the coronavirus. That includes people with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory conditions, according to the WHO.

My child has a health condition. Should I be concerned?

Respiratory conditions such as asthma often result in more severe cases of viral diseases such as influenza. But the coronavirus is new, and it remains unknown whether it will more severely affect children with asthma.

Similarly, there is not yet evidence about whether coronavirus could more negatively affect children with diabetes, which is a risk factor for adults. That said, experts at Johns Hopkins University are warning parents to be vigilant.

Should I keep my kids home from school?

On Monday, the White House recommended parents homeschool their children in an effort to expand social distancing. Here is more information on how to practice social distancing.

Of course, social distancing has caused its own kind of upheaval. Many parents are scrambling after schools closed. Efforts are being made to ease the burden on parents with bored children at home. That includes some celebrities, such as actors Amy Adams and Jennifer Garner, who are reading children’s books online."
'Not ready to go': tributes paid to UK's first named victims of coronavirus,"['Https', 'Www.Theguardian.Com Profile Matthewweaver', 'Matthew Weaver']","Of the more than 2,600 people to have contracted coronavirus in the UK by Wednesday, 104 have died. That figure has more than doubled since Sunday. Most have not been named, and the majority are older people who had underlying health conditions – though in some cases family members and medical professionals have been keen to emphasise that they were expected to live with their conditions for many years.

The youngest person confirmed dead so far was 45-year-old Craig Ruston. Another unnamed victim was 93. Ninety nine of the deaths have been in England, two in Wales, and three in Scotland, with none in Northern Ireland.

Of the deaths so far, details have emerged in at least five cases:

Craig Ruston, 45

Rushton, a rugby fan and father of two from Kettering, Northamptonshire, had been a footwear designer, including at Dr Martens, before being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He had been writing about his struggle with the condition before he tested positive with Covid-19. But his posts became less frequent as he began losing strength in his upper body. In one of his last he wrote about a dream he had of standing beside his wife and daughters at his own funeral. He wrote: “I don’t fear death, but I can tear myself to pieces if I dwell too long on what happens when I’m gone.” His family said he was “not ready to go”. He died on 16 March.

Described by his family as a “typical jolly Irishman”, Gibson died on St Patrick’s Day, 17 March. He was born in County Tyrone and had 12 siblings. After moving to South Yorkshire at the age of 26, he worked at the coking plant at Orgreave. In retirement he enjoyed gardening but problems with his lungs forced him to move into a sheltered housing flat in Oughtibridge, near Sheffield. He died in Sheffield Northern general hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19. His daughters, Lisa, an NHS worker, and Michelle, a teaching assistant, were not allowed to visit him in hospital. Lisa said: “It is sad that we weren’t able to be with Daddy, but the nurses were there for us.”

Described as a “true legend” of the Avon and Somerset police, Matthews retired as a police officer in 2010 after a heart attack. Nick and his wife, Mary, from Nailsea in Somerset, had a week’s holiday on the Canary island of Fuerteventura, at the end of February. Matthews, who was disabled and had underlying health conditions, was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary after complaining of breathing difficulties on 12 March. He died on 14 March after testing positive for Covid-19.

Blakeley was a churchgoer from Middleton, in Rochdale and sang in the choir. He had a “beautiful voice”, according to a spokeswoman for the town’s St Michael’s church. He was also regarded as a “gracious gentleman”, she said. He had underlying health conditions and fell ill after coming into contact with someone who had travelled to Italy. Blakeley was admitted to North Manchester general hospital on 3 March suffering from sepsis. He tested positive for Covid-19 on 10 March and died three days later.

Her colleagues paid tribute to her “passion, creativity and determination”. Finlayson suffered from lung disease and diabetes before she was diagnosed with Covid-19."
Boris Johnson will forever be defined by the coronavirus crisis,['Heather Stewart'],"It is now clear that – for good or ill – Boris Johnson will be remembered for his handling of Covid-19

Little more than six weeks ago, Boris Johnson was pictured jubilantly bashing a tiny gong to celebrate the fact he had “got Brexit done”.

He began 2020 in the most powerful position any prime minister had enjoyed for more than a decade – with a comfortable Commons majority, a lame-duck Labour leader, and the luxury of a five-year term stretching ahead.

He had grand plans for “levelling up” Britain, shaking up Whitehall and remaking the Tory party. And he carried his responsibilities lightly, taking a 10-day Caribbean break over Christmas with his partner.

It is now clear, though, that just as Theresa May’s premiership was broken by Brexit, and Gordon Brown’s defined by the financial crisis, Johnson will forever be remembered – for good or ill – as the coronavirus prime minister.

And while Brown’s decade at the Treasury and dour demeanour made him the ideal leader for the banking crash, nothing in Johnson’s background or political makeup have prepared him for telling the British public to stay out of the pub.

Temperamentally upbeat, with a strong appetite for risk, he is notoriously a (tongue in cheek) admirer of the mayor in Jaws – “a gigantic fish is eating all your constituents and he decides to keep the beaches open. OK, in that instance he was actually wrong. But in principle, we need more politicians like the mayor!” he (half-)joked, when he was running for City Hall.

What a coronavirus lockdown might mean for London Read more

Some observers, including in his own party, fret that this optimistic disposition – combined with a strong anti-authoritarian instinct – has slowed the government’s response to the virus, making Johnson and his team shy away from the most draconian interventions.

The government maintains that every decision throughout the rapidly mounting crisis has been guided by the science – and argues that it is better to do “the right thing at the right time” than to be pressured into kneejerk overreaction.

It also acknowledges that while saving lives is paramount, it has a responsibility to protect livelihoods and jobs too.

Johnson is not much of an ideologue. Even before the coronavirus, his government’s first budget was planned to junk austerity, at least for public investment projects if not the threadbare welfare budget.

And Tuesday’s economic package underlined the fact he is perfectly willing to tear up Tory orthodoxy if that is what it takes to weather the storm – though help for businesses was noticeable faster in coming than for vulnerable households.

But he has appeared to find it much harder to loosen his grip on another tenet of conservatism – personal liberty.

He has so far been unable to muster either the dirigisme of Emmanuel Macron or the moral heft of Leo Varadkar when urging the public to do the right thing, and stay at home.

Johnson dodged the question on Tuesday of whether his septuagenarian father was right to say he might “need” to go to the pub.

And even on Wednesday, when asked whether it was “immoral” to ignore the government guidance, he stressed the importance of “liberty” as a British value, and said people would make their own decisions – before urging them to be “ruthless” in following the rules.

It appears to sit uneasily with Johnson to impose stringent restrictions on the public’s personal lives – so much so that he has at times appeared almost ambivalent about it: nudging or urging instead of ordering.

But he knows it cannot last. He acknowledged on Wednesday that as the virus continued to spread the government might have to go “farther and faster”.

Instead of the heroic mayor who held his nerve and let the bathers keep coming as the shark circled, he appears to have been cast in the role of the leader who shuts down London – not the one he thought he was auditioning for. As one shellshocked Downing Street insider put it this week: “Events, dear boy, events - I know what that means now.”"
White House Coronavirus ‘Stage 3’ Rescue Includes $500 Billion in Income Security Payments to Individuals,['John Carney'],"The Trump administration’s plan for ‘stage 3’ of economic rescue measures includes two rounds of payments to Americans, each in an aggregate amount of $250 billion.

The plan calls for payments to be distributed to individuals on April 6 and May 18, according to a Treasury Department memo obtained by the Washington Post‘s Heather Long.

Payment amounts would be tiered according to income, presumably falling for individuals with higher incomes. The plan calls for payments to go to “individual taxpayers,” likely an indication that the government would use tax rolls and the Internal Revenue Service to distribute money and determine which Americans are eligible for which amounts.

Some advocates of emergency payments have criticized attempts to ‘means-test’ the program, saying it would add complexity, discourage participation, and might short-change individuals whose income has changed drastically because of the coronavirus.

Others, including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, have raised concerns about the government issuing checks to wealthy individuals who do not need assistance.

EVERYBODY SHOULD GET A CHECK In today's @Markets newsletter, I explain why we need the People's TARP, and that means everyone in the country, employed, unemployed, millionaire, billionaire, child, adult, etc should get a check from the government now. https://t.co/e5TYtjIuOw pic.twitter.com/jumuGfaAJ7 — Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) March 18, 2020

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he opposed extending the payments to people “who earn a million dollars.”

The memo also says the payments would be linked to family size, addressing concerns of some pro-family advocates who pointed out a program that paid a flat fee to households or taxpayers would penalize those with large families. The U.S. tax code generally allows taxpayers to set aside more of their income for household support for each dependent family member.

The memo also outlines a $300 billion plan to aid small businesses and their employees through a business interruption loan program. These loans would be made by financial institutions and backed by the federal government for amounts up to 100 percent of 6 weeks payroll, capped at $80,000 annual salary per employee.

Employers would not be allowed to lower wages under the program.

The memo includes $200 billion of aid to businesses thrown into distress by the coronavirus outbreak, with $50 billion set aside for the airline industry.

The plan would authorize the Treasury to backstop the money market mutual funds with a guarantee program, a step the government undertook during the financial crisis. Money market funds are used by many Americans as an alternative to savings accounts and the fund much of the short term credit used by U.S. businesses and financial institutions.

The backstop is meant to prevent a “run on the bank” against these funds, much the way deposit insurance is aimed at discouraging the more traditional bank run of the sort probably familiar to most Americans from the movie It’s a Wonderful Life."
Donald Trump Closing U.S./Canada Border to Non-Essential Traffic,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump announced Wednesday the United States would close the border with Canada to non-essential traffic amid the coronavirus crisis.

Trump announced the border closure after CNN reported details of the discussions between the two countries.

On Tuesday, Trump said he did not want to say he was considering closing the borders between Canada and Mexico.

“We are discussing things with Canada and we’re discussing things with Mexico, quite honestly, and again, the relationship is outstanding with both, outstanding,” he said.

"Ann Coulter: Cheap TVs, Expensive Flu",['Ann Coulter'],"Here’s a thought: While self-quarantining with their families in multimillion-dollar Manhattan co-ops, Wall Street wives ought to have a chat with their Master of the Universe husbands about China, globalism and political correctness. Those are the vectors of their robber-baron wealth.

Thanks to “globalism” — i.e., cheap goods from China — we’ve gotten many wondrous things, for example:

— Toothpaste on American shelves made with a poison found in antifreeze.

— Toxic Chinese drywall installed in about 100,000 U.S. homes, emitting noxious fumes that destroyed electrical wiring and metal fixtures and sickened homeowners. Replacement of the drywall, pipes and wiring cost Americans billions of dollars.

— Hundreds, possibly thousands, of American dogs killed by melamine-laced Chinese dog food in 2007.

— The loss of about 200,000 beautiful maple trees lining the streets of small New England towns, eaten by Asian long-horned beetles that arrived on Chinese cargo ships in 1996. The U.S. taxpayer spends hundreds of millions of dollars to eradicate the repeated outbreaks that continue to this day, despite promises from the Chinese to do better.

— Viral pandemics — H1N1 (from China), bird flu (from China), SARS (from China) and now the Wuhan virus (from China).

Is it really worth paying $3 for a T-shirt at Walmart, rather than $9? The precise reason Chinese goods are so cheap is that they skip the crucial quality-control step.

The media’s reaction to this latest pandemic out of China is to say …

LET’S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT: THE CHINESE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!

Well, like most animal-to-human viruses, this one did originate in China and then spread across the globe when Chinese tourists infected people in other countries.

As described by Melinda Liu in Smithsonian Magazine, the Chinese wet markets, “often poorly ventilated, with multiple species jammed together — create ideal conditions for spreading disease through shared water utensils or airborne droplets of blood and other secretions.”

This 2017 article was titled: “Is China Ground Zero for a Future Pandemic?”

When the pandemic arrived, at least the World Health Organization leapt to action. First step: Find a cure? Develop a vaccine? Demand protections for the elderly?

NO!

WHO officials got together and worked on coming up with a new name for the “Wuhan virus” that sounded less Asian.

Next, the WHO put out a “Fact Sheet” to ensure that those with Kung Flu would not be stigmatized. It instructed:

“DO — talk about people ‘acquiring’ or ‘contracting’ #COVID-19.

“DON’T — talk about people ‘transmitting COVID-19,’ ‘infecting others’ or “spreading the virus’ as it implies intentional transmission & assigns blame.”

As fear of the Chinese virus spread, Gloria Allred brought a lawsuit against a Los Angeles school for sending an Asian student to the school nurse after he coughed in class.

Americans are cowering in their homes. Airlines, restaurants, beaches, ski resorts, professional sports, colleges and stores have been shut down. But we must never violate the fundamental civil right of an Asian to cough in class and refuse to see the nurse!

For a Chinese Traveler, Even Paradise Comes With Prejudice

A few weeks ago — before a trillion dollars in wealth was destroyed by the coronavirus panic and we learned the real disease was racism — everyone, including the Times, admitted that the virus was brought to Italy by two Chinese tourists.

“[T]here had not yet been any confirmed cases in Italy,” the Times reported, until Jan. 30, “when the government announced the first two cases.” The scientific director of an infectious diseases hospital in Rome identified them: “two Chinese tourists visiting Rome.”

The Times buried this fact in an article perversely titled: “Cruise Passengers Are Held at Italian Port in False Alarm Over Coronavirus.” On one hand, a bunch of cruise passengers were inconvenienced for 12 hours; on the other hand, a viral pandemic that could kill millions was introduced to Italy. You write the headline.

Lombardy is the Italian region most devastated by the Wuhan virus. As far back as 2003, a Library of Congress report cited Lombardy as having the highest concentration of Chinese immigrants in Italy. Our media refuses to tell us this fact today — or any day.

No hard feelings, but why not relieve people’s minds? West Virginians who have no contact with anyone visiting from China can rest easy! No need to stockpile toilet paper.

While we’re at it, when will the media and the “medical community” get around to informing Americans that this latest Chinese pandemic poses little danger to anyone under 70 without certain chronic medical conditions?

Italy has been ravaged by the Wuhan virus, but the average age of the dead is 81.

According to the dire estimates of the Imperial College of London — whose assessment we are following — excepting those with underlying medical conditions, the new coronavirus could be less deadly than the seasonal flu to anyone under 60 years old and no worse than the 2017-18 flu season for those in their 60s.

But it’s five to 10 times more deadly than the regular flu for those in their 70s and 80s, respectively.

We ought to surround old folks homes with the National Guard and call it a day. It would probably save more lives and wouldn’t destroy the economy.

But there’s no time to think about saving lives. The important thing is to stamp out the idea that a virus that originated in China has anything to do China."
Hayward: It’s Time to Quarantine the Chinese Communist Party,['John Hayward'],"As nations across the world struggle to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, they should realize it is also long past time to quarantine the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The people of China must understand that their future under the Communist Party is as outcasts, lepers, pariahs – isolated and quarantined by the civilized world. If that is not the future they want, the time to rise up and overthrow the Communists is now.

The future of China is warehouses stuffed full of rotting and decaying goods no one will buy, accounts filled with money they can’t spend, travel instantly blocked at the first sign of pandemic because that’s the only responsible way for the world to handle the Communist Party.

The early days of the Wuhan outbreak provide a deadly and unforgettable lesson that the Communists cannot be trusted to do anything except protect their own political and financial interests. They love to turn the rhetoric of civilized nations against them, nattering on endlessly about global standards, international law, and “win-win cooperation,” but they believe in none of those things. The lives of their own citizens matter very little to the CCP, the lives of foreigners even less.

China kept international officials from visiting the hot zone, politically corrupted the World Health Organization (WHO) – which was advising against travel bans just as the Wuhan virus was exploding into a global pandemic, and wouldn’t even admit it was a “pandemic” until one week ago, when it became impossible to deny the truth – and is now expelling foreign journalists, cutting off the meager trickle of clean information to the outside world.

China is far too opaque, far too dismissive of basic human rights, to be welcomed into reputable international organizations as a full member. The CCP corrupts every organization it joins. It should be expelled from all of them, or relegated to observer status only. WHO could begin this process by correcting the unspeakable injustice of excluding Taiwan to protect China’s vanity. Taiwan should be a full member of WHO, and China should be an observer at best.

That assumes WHO cleans out all of the officials who bowed to the CCP’s demands and becomes an organization worth belonging to. Taiwan’s exemplary handling of the coronavirus may actually have been helped by not being a member of the World Health Organization, insulating the island from Beijing’s propaganda and political demands. What clearer signal could there be that China’s rulers must be quarantined before they can infect any more important international structures with their politics?

The world was left no choice but to handle China this way. It was probably inevitable, communism and fascism being what they are. It’s on us for letting things fester until now because some globalists wanted to get rich quick, and some ideologues can’t call evil when they see it.

China’s system is nominally communist, but its current incarnation is closer to fascism in the most important ways, including the illusion of private commerce dominated and controlled by the CCP. The world must understand there is no such thing as an independent Chinese business or billionaire. Everyone and everything is subject to Party control.

The CCP moved toward fascism – privately “owned” capital that is completely subservient to the authoritarian central government – because it’s more effective than communism, and because they knew globalist business tycoons in the outside world would be more willing to cut deals with nominally private corporations than communally-owned state enterprises. To put it bluntly, fascism can speak the language of capitalism far more convincingly, if no more honestly, than pure communism.

How did the rest of the world allow itself to forget the importance of containing and defeating fascism and communism? We fought an insanely destructive world war to beat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, then a half-century twilight struggle to bring down the Soviet Union. A few years after the Berlin Wall fell, globalists hungry to crack into China’s market and access its cheap labor convinced everyone to forget that communism is incredibly dangerous. The coronavirus is only the latest reminder of a lesson we should never have forgotten, a lesson our forefathers wrote for us in deep red blood and inky black terror.

The notion that economic and cultural “engagement” will liberalize China should be killed stone dead by the Wuhan epidemic. It should have died a long time ago since engagement hasn’t done much to liberalize anyone else. Western intellectuals thought the Soviet Union fell because the Russian people were hungry for blue jeans and rock & roll. They thought they could apply that formula to crack open other authoritarian systems.

Meanwhile, the authoritarians were carefully studying the fall of the Soviet Union and laying plans to ensure such a fate could never befall their squalid tyrannies. For that matter, Russia hasn’t grown much less authoritarian since the End of History in the Nineties, and it’s still a dangerous global adversary.

On the other side of the coin, engagement is clearly threatening to make the free world more authoritarian. Dictatorial ideas like speech codes are spreading across the West. The Chinese Communist Party has far more influence over Hollywood than American citizens living in flyover country. The CCP can force airlines to change their websites and retail outlets to yank T-shirts off the rack because they offend Beijing’s political sensibilities. The CCP even got WHO to change its epidemic map in the depths of the coronavirus crisis because they insisted the map had to identify Taiwan as part of China and include “mainland” infections to inflate Taiwan’s amazingly low total.

Just as the coronavirus must be quarantined before it infects the most vulnerable people of the world, so the Chinese Communist Party must be quarantined before it infects more vulnerable systems across the free world. With an aggressive containment policy, the CCP can be stripped of the money and power it needs to pursue its imperialist foreign agenda and weakened until the people of China can rise up against it.

The time is ripe because the CCP has overextended itself with a massive military buildup and its Belt and Road Initiative, which is a new form of colonialism disguised as an infrastructure program. The disguise is very expensive. Now is the perfect time to begin economic disengagement from China, leaving the CCP with a lot of bills it cannot pay and debts it cannot collect.

The CCP is brutal and seems like an unbeatable foe to its captive people, but it really isn’t. The coronavirus clearly revealed how many Party men are incompetent morons, vicious liars, and simpering cowards. Hong Kong’s long months of bravely defying the CCP is an example, and they’re tiny. A few thousand students in Tiananmen Square looked like an existential threat to the terrified rulers of China, so they crushed the uprising with an act of bloody murder they are still trying to justify, or better yet erase from the history books – with a little help from the Western tech companies the CCP has so much leverage over, of course.

The Chinese are a great people with a long history of daring achievements. They can defeat the Communist Party. The face of China isn’t just the Party hack babbling about America creating the coronavirus. The face of China is also Hong Kong and Taiwan. The face of China is Dr. Li Wenliang, ruthlessly silenced by the CCP for trying to sound an early coronavirus warning that would have saved billions of dollars and thousands of lives across the world, including his own. The face of China is the Nobel Prize winner who should have been sitting in the empty chair set out for him in Oslo. The courage of a thousand generations echoes in the voices of those who speak out against the CCP knowing it could make them disappear at any moment.

It’s time for the people of China to decide which face they will show the world in the century to come. It’s up to all of us, across the free and civilized world, to make it very clear what the consequences of leaving the Communist Party in charge will be."
Donald Trump Signs Coronavirus Relief Bill with Over $100 Billion in Aid,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act on Wednesday, sending over $100 billion in aid to Americans suffering economically from the spread of the Chinese virus.

The president did not sign the bill publicly, as the White House sent a statement from Trump notifying his approval of the legislation.

“The Act makes emergency supplemental appropriations and other changes to law to help the Nation respond to the coronavirus outbreak,” Trump said in his statement.

The bill negotiated between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offers emergency paid sick leave, child care leave, as well as expanded unemployment benefits. It also allows Medicaid funding for free coronavirus testing and additional funds for food assistance programs.

The bill passed 90-8 in the Senate on Wednesday afternoon after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Republicans to support the bill despite concerns from Republican senators.

“This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” McConnell said.

The Senate is currently drafting another massive spending bill to rescue the economy, send money directly to Americans, and bolster businesses facing ruin after the virus sparked economic shutdown.

The White House requested over $1 trillion in funding, as the Senate continues to draft and negotiate the bill as quickly as possible.

“We are going to move here at warp speed for the Senate, which almost never does anything quickly,” McConnell said to reporters on Wednesday."
Italian Study: Most Who Died from Coronavirus Had Pre-Existing Condition,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"An Italian study revealed that most of the patients who have died from the coronavirus previously had some type of illness or pre-existing condition.

But while these people are dying, the majority of coronavirus patients in hospitals are younger, healthier people — and they’re being prioritized by hospital staff.

The average age of those who have died from the Chinese virus in Italy is 79.5, according to a study by Italian health authorities, who have been examining the medical records involving the nation’s surging coronavirus death toll.

The study adds that more than 99 percent of Italy’s coronavirus deaths have been people who were previously ill or had some type of pre-existing medical condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

Among those who have died from the Wuhan virus in Italy, more than 76 percent of them had high blood pressure, more than 35 percent had diabetes, 33 percent had heart disease, and more than 24 percent had atrial fibrillation, or “AFib,” according to Italy’s national health authority.

So far, 17 people under the age of 50 have died from the disease in Italy, all of whom have had some type of previous illness, the study finds.

While the study could provide some insight into why Italy’s coronavirus death rate appears significantly higher than the death rates in other countries — about eight percent — another factor to take into consideration is that the young, healthier people are overwhelming the Italian hospitals.

While older people — as well as younger people with pre-existing conditions — are dying from the Chinese virus in Italy, the majority of coronavirus patients occupying ICU beds are younger than the average age of those who die from the virus, and they’re being prioritized by hospital staff, doctors say.

“If someone between 80 and 95 has serious breathing difficulties, you probably don’t proceed,” admitted an anesthetist at a hospital in Bergamo.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Bergamo has stated that patients who cannot be treated for the coronavirus “are left to die” by doctors who are forced to overlook older, sicker patients in order to make room for those who are younger and more likely to survive.

Among those occupying Italian hospitals, 12 percent are between the ages of 19 and 50, about 52 percent are between the ages of 51 and 70, with the remainder all over 70, according to inews UK.

Therefore, roughly 64 percent of coronavirus patients are reportedly under the age of 70.

The study by Italian health authorities had also noted that while the average age of those who succumb to the coronavirus is 79.5, the average age of those who become infected with the disease is 63.

“Even if the data is only preliminary, the fact there are more young people hospitalized and in intensive care compared to the first wave can be interpreted as a natural phenomenon,” said Pisa University professor Pierluigi Lopalco to Corriere della Sera.

“In Italy, the first clusters of the infection started around hospitals, more commonly frequented by older people, and in small towns,” he added. “Now, the virus has spread.”

“It is travelling around the whole country way more,” said Lopalco, “and it is younger people with lots of social contact that are more at risk of contracting the disease if they do not stick to the rules of social distancing.”

"CNN Embraced ‘Racist’ Terms ‘Chinese Coronavirus,’ ‘Wuhan Coronavirus’",['Hannah Bleau'],"CNN in January used the terms “Chinese coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus” to reference the virus wreaking havoc on the globe — a detail largely ignored by several political pundits and reporters who are taking issue with President Trump using similar terminology.

Trump came under fire on Tuesday after using the term “Chinese Virus,” with critics immediately labeling his descriptor “racist.”

“I have to call it where it came from, it did come from China, so I think it’s a very accurate term,” he told reporters on Tuesday, adding that “China was putting out information which was false, that our military gave this to them, that was false.”

The president said he did not believe it created an unfair “stigma,” adding, “I think that saying our military gave it to them creates a stigma.”

Despite that, Trump’s critics have zeroed in on the narrative that referring to the virus as “Chinese,” is racist. His failed opponent, Hillary Clinton, even accused the president of using “racist rhetoric.” However, several establishment outlets have used the very descriptor they are shellacking the president over, including CNN.

“A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected more than 200 people since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December,” CNN tweeted in January. “Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans”:

A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected more than 200 people since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans. https://t.co/mnZKFC5ZDW — CNN (@CNN) January 21, 2020

The article itself contained a similar lede:

(CNN)A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans.

What is more, CNN’s article also refers to the virus as the “Wuhan coronavirus” eight times — another descriptor that several of Trump’s critics have deemed a “racist” term.

Emphasis added:

It’s not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops. … The Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. … Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the Wuhan coronavirus, but experts are now trying to understand who is transmitting it most, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community. … MERS, SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus appear to cause more severe disease in older people, though uncertainty remains around the latest outbreak. Of the cases of Wuhan coronavirus reported so far, none are yet confirmed to be among children, Horby said. … Should you worry about the Wuhan coronavirus? … The Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, but still comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, explains Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London. … Awareness is key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.

CNN is not the only outlet that has used the terms, which several progressives now deem “offensive.”

Breitbart News previously reported a partial list:

Trump again defended his use of the term “Chinese virus” on Wednesday.

“Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?” ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked.

“Why do you keep using this?” she pressed. “A lot of people say it’s racist.”

“It’s not racist at all. No, it comes from China – that’s why I want to be accurate,” Trump said.

Left Touts Coronavirus: Economy Shutting Down Fights Climate Change,['Penny Starr'],"The media is celebrating that the coronavirus –– which has killed over 3,000 in China –– could be combating climate change as nations’ economies around the world are ground to a halt.

CNN reported on the “blue skies” in China in recent days:

Factories were shuttered and streets were cleared across China’s Hubei province as authorities ordered residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. It seems the lockdown had an unintended benefit — blue skies. The average number of “good quality air days” increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year, according to China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

NASA, which promotes climate change on its website, released images that show a reduction of nitrogen dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial plants during January and February — the height of the coronavirus pandemic in China.

“This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the CNN report. “I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize the spread of the virus.”

The Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), an “air pollution research organization,” hailed the reduction of coal production, an energy source that helps save lives in China as a source for warming homes.

Leftists hope this trend continues.

“We would very much advocate for China to foster this opportunity to transform its economy, to break apart from the old,” Li Shuo, a senior climate policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, said in the CNN report.

“There might be a round of economic stimulus which would inject cheap credits to heavy industries in China, and as a result of that we might see increasing pollutants and also carbon emissions in the second half of this year,” Li said.

But communist China is planning to reboot its economy.

“President Xi has made clear that workers and factories need to ramp up activity as soon as possible if the country is to avoid a steeper economic downturn,” CNN reported.

ICE Reduces Arrests of Illegal Aliens amid Wuhan Fears,['Neil Munro'],"The nation’s immigration enforcement agency is reducing its arrests of illegal migrants amid growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak in federal detention centers.

“ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) will focus enforcement on public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds,” said a press statement issued on March 18. “For those individuals who do not fall into those categories, ERO will exercise discretion to delay enforcement actions until after the crisis or utilize alternatives to detention, as appropriate.”

“This is a return to ‘felons, not families,'” which was the policy adopted by President Barack Obama, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a pro-migration advocate at the American Immigration Council. “Though I strongly suspect ICE will not revert to the prosecutorial discretion policies of the Obama administration and that this will primarily impact who is targeted for arrest,” he added.

Up to 50,000 recent migrants and violent illegal migrants are already detained in centers around the nation. Federal courtrooms remain open while their deportation cases are being processed, according to pro-migration lawyers.

The statement was released after President Donald Trump said he would block additional visitors, migrants, and asylum seekers at the southern and northern borders. The statement, however, did not say if the United States has permission from Mexico’s government to return migrants from Mexico back into Mexico after they are caught at the border.

White-collar immigration lawyers and pro-migration groups are still demanding that Trump admit the roughly 30,000 migrants who have been sent back to Mexico before their asylum hearings in the United States.

The large population of illegal residents in the United States reduces wages for blue-collar Americans — especially amid the economic crash spurred by migrants from China.

This may be one unforeseen cost of the tech sector's preference for visa-workers. https://t.co/MRVZ1HLGT6 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 17, 2020

The ICE statement continued:

Homeland Security Investigations will continue to carry out mission critical criminal investigations and enforcement operations as determined necessary to maintain public safety and national security. Examples include investigations into child exploitation, gangs, narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, human smuggling, and continued participation on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. This work will be conducted based on ability to coordinate and work with prosecutors from the Department of Justice and intake at both the U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons.

The statement also said that ICE would not arrest migrants who are seeking medical care because of China’s disease:

Consistent with its sensitive locations policy, during the COVID-19 crisis, ICE will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, accredited health clinics, and emergent or urgent care facilities, except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Individuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement.

Numerous cities and countries have begun releasing American criminals to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. It is not clear what the released criminals will do to earn a living."
Biden Adviser Sanders: Trump Referred to Coronavirus by ‘a Racial Slur’,['Ian Hanchett'],"On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Biden Campaign Senior Adviser Symone Sanders said that while some of what President Trump said during that day’s coronavirus briefing was good, he also referred to the coronavirus by “a racial slur.”

Sanders said, “Testing is still a real issue. We were happy to see the Trump administration and the president come out to the podium today and enact a number of sweeping changes. But the reality is, we have to ensure that we are doing what’s best for the American people. That means testing. That means being as innovative and creative as we can. But that also means being transparent.”

She added, “[I]f the Trump administration is getting the number of tests out that they said are going to get out, then that is amazing. But the reality is, we have not seen the tests that the Trump administration promised in the field and we have not seen those results yet. Now, results could be coming. … And some of what he said today was good. But the reality is, he also stood at the podium and called the coronavirus, COVID-19, what I would suggest is a racial slur.”

Host Martha MacCallum then mentioned Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) as an example of a disease that is named after where it originated and also brought up China’s obfuscation on the virus.

Sanders responded that China refused to let American scientists in to research the virus, but maintained that Trump’s name for the virus is “offensive” and that testing and informing the public are the key issues.

2nd Amendment Red Alert! FBI Could Stop Approving Gun Sales Soon,['Kelen Mcbreen'],"Due to a historic spike in gun sales and ensuing background checks sparked by COVID-19 fears, the FBI is warning “offices in charge of conducting the background checks could shut down, effectively stopping sales.”

According to Washington Examiner, “Fears of a crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in an historic spike in gun purchase background checks, leading to long delays in approval.”

The FBI’s National Instant Background Criminal Background Check System (NICS) released a statement, explaining, “As the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Section works through the impact of the COVID-19 operationally, we are working to maintain our services.”

“We are aware that states may be considering options to protect the health and safety of their employees, which may include a reduction in office availability or even closure to some offices,” the press release continues.

The FBI conducted 1 million more background checks in the months of January and February of 2020 than they did in the same two months last year.

On Monday, March 16, 2020, the FBI’s NICS told the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) background check traffic saw a 300 percent increase from the same date in 2019.

Meanwhile, New Orleans, Louisiana, Fresno, California and Champaign, Illinois have outlawed the sale of firearms and ammunition in the name of coronavirus safety.

Billionaire Bill Ackman: “America Will End As We Know It” Unless Trump Shuts Down Borders,['Paul Joseph Watson'],"Billionaire Bill Ackman has warned President Trump that unless he totally shuts down the borders, sends people home for 30 days and has the government cover their wages, “America will end as we know it.”

Following up from a tweet in which he called on Trump to “shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders,” Ackman told CNBC “hell is coming” and the entire system of capitalism would collapse unless drastic measures were taken now.

Mr. President, the only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders. Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family. Keep only essential services open. The government pays wages until we reopen. — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) March 18, 2020

“You cant borrow your way out of the problem, you can’t lend your way out of the crisis.. you have to kill the virus,” said Ackman.

“What’s scaring the American people and corporate America now is the gradual rollout,” Ackman told CNBC’s Scott Wapner. “We need to shut it down now… This is the only answer.”

“Capitalism does not work in an 18-month shutdown, capitalism can work in a 30-day shutdown,” he warned, noting that the hotel, airline and restaurant industries will go completely bankrupt if the situation drags on for longer than a month.

“Beginning in late January I was getting increasingly bearish and I woke up with a nightmare,” Ackman said, adding that he personally went into lockdown a month ago to save his father, who is immunocompromised.

“And my nightmare was you have this virus that replicates and infects incredibly rapidly,” he added.

Calling on all Americans to make sacrifices, the billionaire pleaded, “[The president] is not saying storm the beaches of Normandy right, he’s saying go home, go home, spend a month with your family.”

If he takes these measures and saves America from coronavirus, Trump is guaranteed re-election in November, according to Ackman.

'We Defend Europe's Borders' - Austrian Commandos Square Off With Turkish Police,[],"Austrian commandos were reportedly confronted by Turkish police along the Greek border as European forces continue to guard the continent against an aggressive migrant invasion.

A team from Austria's elite special forces unit ""Cobra"" has been patrolling Greece's eastern frontier in an armored vehicle as part of an agreement between Vienna and Athens amid the ongoing border crisis initiated by Turkish President Erdogan, according to Proto Thema.

“What are you doing here, since it is not your country?” Turkish police reportedly asked the Austrians during a face-to-face confrontation at the border fence.

“Here is our country and we are defending the European border,” Cobra commanders responded.

Yesterday #Austria 🇦🇹 EKO Cobra specia forces came face to face with the #Turkey authorities, Turks shouted at them: ""What are you doing here, is not your country"" & the Austrians responded: ""Here is our country and we are defending the EU border.""

Roughly 300-500 migrants attempted to storm the border Tuesday night with the aid of Turkish police who flooded the zone with tear gas and other chemicals, according to reports.

“Hundreds of foreigners, standing one breath away from the fence, are apparently waiting for instructions from the Turkish authorities for their next move,” Proto Thema reported on Tuesday afternoon with accompanying photos.

“The nightly episode began at about 2:30 pm and lasted until 4 am Wednesday morning near the Kastanies border checkpoint and part of the fence preventing illegal immigrants from entering a radius of about 150 meters. It is estimated that about 300 to 500 migrants attempted to cross into Greek territory under cover of Turkish police officers who discharged chemicals and smoke around Greek police.”

Border patrols in Greece have prevented more than 53,000 attempted illegal entries since Turkey 'opened the floodgates' in the last days of February.

Authorities Arrest Person For ‘Falsely Claiming’ to Have Coronavirus,['Dan Lyman'],"Texas police say they arrested a person for falsely claiming on social media to be infected with coronavirus.

“Over the weekend, an individual in Tyler County falsely reported on social media that the individual tested positive for COVID-19 at Tyler County Hospital,” the Tyler County District Attorney’s office announced in a Facebook post.

“The case was promptly investigated by the Tyler County Sheriff’s Office and delivered to the District Attorney’s Office.”

The unidentified individual has been charged with a Class A Misdemeanor, False Alarm/False Report.

The announcement elicited mixed reactions from users, with one accusing Texas authorities of behaving like their contemporaries in China, where COVID-19 originated.

In a follow-up post, the DA’s office warned, “Knowingly communicating, initiating, or circulating a false report/false alarm of COVID-19 that one *knows is false or baseless*, and that would ordinarily cause action by an official or interrupt the occupation of any place of assembly, can be a criminal offense in the State of Texas.”

There are at least 83 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Texas at the time of this writing, but none in Tyler County.

"Tom Brady to leave New England Patriots, play elsewhere next season","['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com', 'Foxbusiness.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']","Tom Brady announced Tuesday he is leaving the New England Patriots after 20 seasons and six Super Bowl titles, saying his football journey “will take place elsewhere.”

Brady made the announcement on his Instagram account after thanking team owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick.

TOM BRADY, BUCCANEERS RUMORS HEAT UP AS NFL FREE AGENCY NEARS

“To all my teammates, coaches, executives and staff, Coach Belichick, RKK, and the Kraft family and the entire organization. I want to say thank you for the past twenty years of my life and the daily commitment to winning and creating a winning culture built on great values. I am grateful for all that you have taught me – I have learned from everyone. You all have allowed me to maximize my potential and that is all a player can hope for. Everything we have accomplished brings me great joy and the lessons I have learned will carry on with me forever. I couldn’t be the man I am today without the relationships you have allowed me to build with you. I have benefited from all you have given me. I cherished every opportunity I had to be a part of our team, and I love you all for that. Our team has always set a great standard in pro sports and I know it will continue to do just that.

“Although my football journey will take play elsewhere, I appreciate everything that we have achieved and am grateful for our incredible TEAM accomplishments. I have been privileged to have the opportunity to know each and everyone of you, and to have the memories we’ve created together.”

The lengthy posted was captioned: “FOREVER A PATRIOT.”

TOM BRADY'S DEPARTURE FROM PATRIOTS APPEARS IMMINENT AS NO DEAL FROM EITHER SIDE IN PLACE, NFL INSIDER SAYS

The Patriots selected Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft out of Michigan. He got a chance to start for the team in his second season in 2001 when Drew Bledsoe went down with an injury. He took the reins from there and never looked back, helping the Pats win their first-ever Super Bowl and transforming the team in the juggernaut it's now known as.

Brady won the NFL MVP award three times with New England, was selected to the Pro Bowl 14 times and was an All-Pro three times. He was named the 2009 AP Comeback Player of the Year and won the AP Offensive Player of the Year award in 2007 and 2010.

The noise about Brady potentially leaving the Patriots began during the 2019 season. While the rumblings were small, Brady didn’t exactly commit to playing for the Patriots in 2020 while talking to reporters in training camp in August. He acknowledged that he had one year on his deal left but said: “We’ll see what happens.” He said that he plans to play until he is 45.

Brady started to talk about his future more in October. He said in a radio interview that there will be a time where he has had “enough,” but those decisions will be coming at the “appropriate times.”

NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS OFFER TOM BRADY ONE-YEAR CONTRACT FOR LESS THAN PREVIOUS SEASON: REPORT

“That is the great part for me, I don’t know,” Brady told WEEI's ""The Greg Hill Show."" “I think that has been a unique situation that I have been in because I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years you kind of feel like [there is] the responsibility to always fulfill the contract.”

He added: “For me, it’s been good because I am just taking it day-by-day and I am enjoying what I have. I don’t know what the future holds and the great part is for me, football at this point is all borrowed time.”

Days later, he told Fox News contributor Jim Gray on his Westwood One radio program that “nothing has changed” for him and that the goal was still to play until he was 45.

“I don’t know why it's being brought up,"" Brady said. ""I had a good quote that came to mind. Somebody told me that ‘the past and the future are in the mind. I’m in the now,’ and I think that’s a great way to live life. I’m not thinking about many things beyond this week.”

He added: “It’s probably that time of year where you don’t need to focus so much on the wins and losses, you start focusing on a lot of other things and I think the media has the right to do that. I certainly don’t. I’m focused on what I need to do this year.”

Brady said he was focused on staying healthy, something he was adamant about in August.

Brady’s trainer, Alex Guerrero, added a new wrinkle into the quarterback’s future in November. He said in a radio interview that his client planned to play until he was 46 or 47.

NEW YORK JETS' ROBBY ANDERSON DREAMS ABOUT TOM BRADY'S FUTURE: 'WE WERE ON THE SAME TEAM'

“No one thought you could play at the elite level in your late 30s, early 40s. That is something we always felt we could do. I have really wanted to be there to help him accomplish that goal. I certainly do believe that 45 is a very realistic goal,” Guerrero said

Guerrero added: “We talk about it all the time. Every year he just adds another year. He goes in and he’s like, ‘Guys, I feel so good still. I think I am going to go till 45.’ I am like, ‘OK.’ Now he’s like, ‘Alex, I think I can go like 46 or 47.’”

As Brady’s performances on the field appeared to diminish, questions about his future got louder. He had 24 touchdown passes, 4,057 passing yards and eight interceptions in 2019. But over his last eight games, his completion rate was only at 57 percent and he only threw 11 touchdown passes. He also took 14 sacks in that span.

Brady mentioned in a “Today” interview that even his mother or wife would prefer that he retired because they hate seeing him take hits on the field.

Brady’s adamant line about playing until he was 45 was tweaked just a bit on Dec. 23 in a separate interview with Gray.

TOM BRADY WANTS THESE 2 THINGS IN ORDER TO LEAVE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: REPORT

“I think I've said for a long time, my tune hasn't changed, I hope to continue playing,” Brady said. “I've had long-term goals, I've had short-term goals, football is a contact sport, you never know when your last game is going to be and you should count your blessing every time you walk off the field healthy.”

Health became a huge factor toward the end of the year. Brady was battling tennis elbow and reportedly suffered a foot injury in December. It could have hampered him during the team’s playoff loss against the Tennessee Titans. After the game, Brady addressed once again whether he would retire.

“I would say it’s pretty unlikely,” Brady said, adding “hopefully unlikely.”

“I love the Patriots. It's the greatest organization. Playing for Mr. [Robert] Kraft all these years, and for Coach [Bill] Belichick, there's nobody who's had a better career, I would say, than me -- just being with them. So I'm very blessed,” he said.

“I don't know what the future looks like, so I'm not going to predict it.”

While the AFC wild card game may have been his last at Gillette Stadium, fans hoping he would stay greeted him with raucous chants and even signs that read, “Please Stay Tommy.”

“I personally appreciate everything they've contributed -- not just this year, but a lot of years,” he said. “Just very grateful for the experience playing this year for the team, this organization, and over the course of my career, too. I appreciate it. I hope I've always tried to do the right thing out there. Who knows what the future holds? So I'll leave it at that.”

He added: “I don't know what's going to happen. I'm not going to predict it. No one needs to make choices at this point. I love playing football. I love playing for this team. I've loved playing for this team for two decades and winning a lot of games. I don't know what it looks like moving forward, so we'll just take it day-to-day.”

In early January, after losing to the Titans, Brady posted an Instagram picture with a caption saying he had ""more to prove."" He didn't mention anything about returning to the Patriots.

Brady also teased a possible announcement days before Super Bowl LIV. However, the tease was for a Hulu advertisement in which he vowed he wasn’t going anywhere.

TOM BRADY SQUASHES RETIREMENT BUZZ DURING SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL: 'I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE'

It’s unclear what Brady does now. His contract will void Wednesday and it appears the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the major players for the quarterback.

According to multiple reports, the Buccaneers are rumored to “pull out all the stops” and have already made “an aggressive pitch” to the legendary quarterback.

The latest tidbit of information surrounding Brady and free agency came two days after WEEI’s Dale Arnold revealed Brady was offered a one-year contract for less than what he made last year. The offer was reportedly made during a conversation Brady and coach Bill Belichick had earlier this month.

According to ESPN, Brady has two demands when deciding which team he is going to play for next. He wants to be a part of the roster construction and wants to be a part of the decision-making on offensive play calls.

Doctors are making difficult decisions about daily life, cash-strapped hospitals are struggling to order ventilators, and authorities nationwide are turning to lockdowns, mass closures and bans on large gatherings as they try to “flatten the curve.""

But a chilling new U.K. study raises the question of whether it may be enough. The study, reportedly being examined by the White House’s coronavirus task force, suggested that only trying to slow the spread of the virus could nonetheless overwhelm hospital beds and lead to upwards of a million deaths in the United States.

As of late Wednesday, more than 8,700 cases had been reported across the United States, including more than 130 deaths. Two members of Congress, Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), said Wednesday they had tested positive.

New York in particular announced a steep climb of 1,008 new cases since Tuesday, through Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) attributed the increase to expanded testing. The state now has more confirmed cases than all but 10 countries in the world.

Also on Wednesday, White House officials announced several measures to tighten the United States’s land borders: Authorities would immediately send migrants who cross the southern border illegally back to Mexico, they said, while closing the northern border to nonessential traffic.

The outbreak and its dramatic impact on the economy appear to be redefining Donald Trump’s presidency, with more than half of Americans saying he has downplayed the virus too much, according to a new survey.

Throughout the day on Wednesday, Trump ramped up his attempts to rebrand the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,"" brushing aside concerns that is unscientific and could incite racial attacks."

That is math, not prophecy. The spread can be slowed, public health professionals say, if people practice “social distancing” by avoiding public spaces and generally limiting their movement.

Still, without any measures to slow it down, covid-19 will continue to spread exponentially for months. To understand why, it is instructive to simulate the spread of a fake disease through a population.

We will call our fake disease simulitis. It spreads even more easily than covid-19: whenever a healthy person comes into contact with a sick person, the healthy person becomes sick, too."
U.S. coronavirus death toll surpasses 100,"['Reis Thebault', 'National', 'Breaking News Reporter', 'Abigail Hauslohner', 'National Reporter Focusing On Immigrant Communities In America', 'Jacqueline Dupree', 'Newsroom Intranet Editor']","Of the first 100 reported fatalities, many people appear to have had underlying health conditions, making it harder for their bodies to fight off covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Some had diabetes, kidney failure, hypertension or pulmonary ailments.

AD

AD

Nearly all — about 85 percent — were older than 60, and about 45 percent were older than 80. It’s unclear how some of them contracted the disease, but more than a third were living in residential care facilities when they became ill.

What is known about the scale of transmission and the high number of deaths among vulnerable populations — like at the Life Care Center of Kirkland in Washington state, where 27 of the facility’s 120 residents have died — has experts deeply concerned.

“I see that as the ‘canary in a coal mine’ situation,” said Fred Buckner, an attending physician at the University of Washington Medical Center. “I suspect it’s going to be taking off in other locations just like it is in the Seattle area. There’s no reason not to think that. Obviously, that means more deaths.”

AD

In addition to the cluster of cases at Life Care Center, health authorities are monitoring cases at Lambeth House Retirement Community in New Orleans, a high-rise with about 250 residences and rooms. Of the four people who have died in New Orleans, two had been at Lambeth, where there are 12 additional cases, spokesman Greg Beuerman said.

AD

Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: “One particularly unsettling aspect of the outbreak [at Life Care Center] is the number of residents who have gotten sick and died in that facility. That’s a very high fraction.”

The early profiles of those who have fallen victim to covid-19 should be “a reminder that this virus can be very dangerous,” Rivers added. “It should serve as additional motivation to take every opportunity to reduce transmission.”

Darlene Kimball, 72, was one of those who died of covid-19 after a stay at Life Care Center. The avid gardener, animal lover and grandmother of five had been living with ovarian cancer for four years when she fell in mid-February and went to Life Care Center for rehabilitation, said her daughter, Tami Kahler.

AD

AD

Kimball at that point was lucid, talkative and mobile. She was in the process of finding a new oncologist.

But at Life Care Center, she developed a cough, becoming increasingly raspy and finding it difficult to breathe. While visiting Kimball — who was surrounded by her children, grandchildren and friends “24 hours a day,” Kahler said in an interview — family members noticed that much of the facility’s residents appeared to be sick. When Kimball began complaining of chest pains in late February, they urged a nurse to call the hospital.

It was only after the doctors and nurses had started wearing masks and gowns in Kimball’s presence; after her pneumonia was diagnosed and she was transferred to hospice care; and after the family pleaded for a coronavirus test that Kahler said her mother got one.

AD

AD

“They got the results back on Thursday,” March 5, Kahler said. “She died Friday.

Since the first U.S. death, on Feb. 26 in Washington state, a death has been reported somewhere in the United States nearly every day. At first, the numbers increased by two or three people, but by Friday, agencies were reporting more than half a dozen per day. Monday had the largest increase yet, when 24 deaths were reported in a single day.

People have died in 18 states.

U.S. testing continues to lag, obscuring the number of possible cases and fatalities, and almost all health departments have declined to release names of the victims, citing privacy laws.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in guidance issued to clinicians, has put the overall case fatality rate for patients with no underlying conditions at 0.9 percent. But the danger climbs with age and with chronic health conditions. For diabetics, the risk of death is 7 percent. For those with cardiovascular disease, it’s more than 10 percent, and for patients older than 80, the fatality rate is more than 14 percent.

AD

AD

The death rate is close to 50 percent for patients who develop the severe complications of respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction. There is no treatment for covid-19 except supportive care.

The rising toll in the United States is following the pattern of deaths in the countries that have been hit the hardest.

In China, where the disease has killed more than 3,000, a study of early coronavirus cases in Wuhan — where the first case was diagnosed — found that the odds of a patient dying rose with age and a host of underlying maladies, such as a lower level of organ function.

The study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal the Lancet, found that preexisting health conditions were present in two-thirds of those who died, with hypertension and diabetes the most common afflictions.

AD

AD

A Kaiser Family Foundation report published last week hints at Americans’ vulnerabilities: Four in 10 adults are older than 60 or have serious underlying medical conditions. That means 105 million adults in the United States are at high risk of becoming severely ill if infected.

At Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, John Dwyer, an infectious-disease specialist and an assistant professor of medicine, said this week that he was already seeing a disturbing harbinger of what is to come.

“We have several obese patients, which is one challenge I think we’re going to have nationwide in the United States because of the levels of obesity that we have,” said Dwyer, who on Monday said Tulane had “just received our sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth positive results about 10 minutes ago,” less than a week after running its first test.

AD

AD

“We have a lot of patients with diabetes and hypertension down here in Louisiana and those patients tend to do worse,” Dwyer said. “We also have a large amount of uninsured people who don’t always have access to care, and we have a lot of people who don’t have access to transportation.”

Of the nine people hospitalized at Tulane with the disease, four were in the intensive care unit, including a 27-year-old woman with multiple preexisting conditions, who had been on a mechanical ventilator.

And none of those patients were known to have traveled to another country. Dwyer said he thinks cases in New Orleans have been spread locally, what scientists call community transmission.

AD

At Life Care Center, family members and friends came and went until the facility imposed a strict isolation policy. Kahler said that as many as 30 people surrounded her mother during her final two weeks of illness, and that none have become sick.

AD

But the daughter and son-in-law of Mary Whiteside, 90, another Life Care resident who also died, both contracted the disease, said Whiteside’s son James Whiteside . His sister spent days in intensive care and is now improving, he said.

The contagion that has shut down much of the nation has imposed the cruelest protocol on the sickest: Those who die are dying mostly alone.

Buckner, the doctor at the University of Washington Medical Center, saw his first coronavirus patient on March 4. The man, in his 80s, was a resident at the Ida Culver House Ravenna senior home in Seattle, and was admitted to the emergency room with breathing trouble. The man was tested for coronavirus and his results came back the next day: positive.

Buckner and a colleague donned gowns, gloves and face masks to tell the man his diagnosis.

The man, speaking through his oxygen mask, was incredulous: “How the hell did I get that? How long does it take to get over this?”

Buckner delivered the answer gently.

The man’s other medical problems — kidney failure, high blood pressure and a history of lung disease — ruled out an experimental drug and a ventilator. He would remain in strict isolation, with no visitors allowed. His fate lay with the strength of his immune system.

Four days later, he died.

“That is a very painful, sad thing to see — someone in their last days having to go through it basically alone,” Buckner said. “They have the nurses and doctors, but they don’t have their family. That just adds to the tragedy of this.”

Mary Whiteside, too, spent her last four days alone, in a Seattle-area hospital, before her death. The great-grandmother and devoted University of Michigan sports fan had been recovering well from surgery at Life Care Center and was supposed to be discharged. Then the virus struck. Her relatives hope they will be able to hold a memorial service for her in the summer.

“I think the hardest thing for people losing family or friends to complications from this is that you can’t grieve properly because of what’s going on in our society,” said Matthew Gness, whose father, John Gness, 78, died in Florida from covid-19 on Saturday.

“You can’t really see your friends and family with all the social distancing and stuff, and there’s the preoccupation of having enough food and supplies, and just being distracted by all that kind of stuff,” said Gness, who works at a health-care laboratory and expects his professional life to soon be upended by the disease.

And now, “they are limiting everywhere — you can’t host a venue of 25 people or more,” he said. “So it interferes with even planning a funeral.”"
Experts debate whether ‘senior-only’ shopping hours protect the elderly from getting covid-19,"['Lateshia Beachum', 'General Assignment Reporter']","Dollar General and Stop and Shop will open their doors early just to senior citizens and those with compromised immune systems, the companies announced.

The seniors-only hour kicked off at Dollar General locations on Tuesday. Massachusetts-based Stop and Shop rolls out the plan on Thursday. Dollar General’s first opening hour will be dedicated to seniors. Stop and Shop stores will serve customers 60 and older between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.

AD

AD

Dollar General wants to help seniors shop in a less busy environment, said company spokeswoman Crystal Ghassemi. “We want to make sure that, just given their higher susceptibility to the virus, that it gives them an opportunity to have a little bit more pleasant shopping experience,” she said.

Older adults and people with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk of contracting covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early data from China CDC indicated the virus can be fatal for older adults, especially those older than 80.

The special senior hours at both stores are meant to provide a safe environment for older customers and immune-compromised consumers, but experts question how protective the environments really are.

AD

AD

Not all grocers are following the path of Dollar General and Stop and Shop. H-E-B, a San Antonio-based grocery store with hundreds of locations throughout Texas and northeastern Mexico, told CNN that it will not have such an hour, based on recommendations from health officials.

“We feel asking a group to congregate at our stores in a certain time frame is not a safe idea,” the company told the news outlet in a statement.

There’s no such thing as being too cautious as a senior citizen during this time, but the details of how these shopping hours would benefit them are questionable, according to Alysa Krain, an infectious disease doctor who specializes in geriatric medicine at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.

AD

“Right away, that kind of makes me nervous,” she said, adding that she and her colleagues are advising their elderly patients to have friends and relatives shop for them. “It was a good idea in general, but it’s a little bit dangerous if it’s not controlled.”

AD

Krain said stores should still be mindful about ensuring that seniors keep at least six feet between them and other people, and to dissuade crowds beyond 50 people.

Stop and Shop stores currently don’t have plans to establish crowd limits, but each location is closely adhering to the guidance of local government, according to company spokeswoman Jennifer Brogan. “I don’t think we’ll know exactly what the demand will be until Thursday,” she said.

AD

The company doesn’t anticipate space between customers as being an issue, considering the size of most stores, she said.

Dollar General is encouraging customers who aren’t elderly to give the older shoppers the time and space they need to shop more safely, Ghassemi said.

Bettina Fries, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook Medicine, echoed concerns about the number of seniors in a space but saw potential for the at-risk population.

AD

“I hope the scattered shopping hours would lead to seniors being in a store with less people,” she said. “It’s less likely that you will have [a] senior with coronavirus in a store because they’re less likely to be asymptomatic.""

AD

Grocery stores could also offer delivery services to seniors, an option Stop and Shop has, and take phone orders to accommodate technological challenges, she said.

Community members could pitch in by delivering groceries to their senior neighbors as the country grapples with reducing infection through social distancing.

“Western countries are struggling much more. Think about how many people don’t evacuate during hurricane season,” she said, adding that young and old people should stay inside as much as possible.

While the country awaits a decrease in confirmed cases, Dollar General and Stop and Shop say they will offer their special hours for the unforeseeable future."

Delta’s stock was down nearly 30 percent in another volatile day on Wall Street. It’s share price, around $22.50, was off almost $37 per share from its value at the start of the year.

“Cash preservation remains our top financial priority right now,” Bastian wrote. “Making swift decisions now to reduce the losses and preserve cash will provide us the resources to rebound from the other side of this crisis and protect Delta’s future.”

In that vain, he wrote, the company plans to hunker down and try to save $4 billion in cash in the coming quarter. It is idling more than 600 aircraft and closing down the majority of its Delta Sky Club premium lounges. Various company leaders have taken voluntary pay cuts and the company’s board of directors agreed to forgo its salary for six months.

Bastian also encouraged employees to take voluntary leave, writing that such breaks are “one of the best and most immediate ways you can help as we strive to protect jobs and pay.” The company was not yet at a point, he wrote, to make any assurances over job cuts and compensation security.

But Delta’s plan to weather the coming financial hardship is reliant upon bailout funds from Congress to support the airline industry. The Trump Administration has floated a plan to send $50 billion to the airline industry as part of a $1 trillion conoravirus-rebound stimulus package.

The airline industry’s advocacy group said carriers needed another $25 billion in loans and tax relief. Airports have also asked for their own bailout program.

Bastian wrote that he was “optimistic that our industry will receive support to help address this crisis.”"

The number of reported cases of covid-19 continues to rise in the United States, where testing was slow to begin. The disease, caused by a new coronavirus, has been confirmed in every state.

Confirmed cases Reported deaths

The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.

“We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity — and by the alarming levels of inaction,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Worldwide, well over 150,000 cases of the disease, which can cause pneumonia-like symptoms, have been recorded since the outbreak started in late 2019, and several thousand people have died.

The virus has been detected on every continent except Antarctica and in more than 100 countries, with concentrations of thousands of cases in some areas. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a “public health emergency.”

Confirmed cases Reported deaths

The Trump administration has imposed restrictions on travelers from countries including China, Iran, and most European countries and is cautioning against travel to other places.

China has reported the most cases worldwide, with a majority in the Hubei province, where Chinese health officials said the new virus strain originated in wild animals sold at a market in the capital city of Wuhan. In recent weeks, as the number of new cases climbed around the world, the number in China has slowed.

Confirmed cases

Coronaviruses range from the common cold virus to more serious diseases that can infect humans and animals, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

Democratic primaries highlights: Sanders to assess his campaign; primary schedule in flux amid pandemic,"['John Wagner', ""National Reporter On The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"", 'Congress', 'Campaigns', 'Health Policy', 'Pennsylvania Politics', 'Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]","PHOENIX — The first hours of voting across Arizona appeared to be running smoothly, as state and county election officials pointed to a surge in early voting ballots that are expected to make up about 80 percent of the overall vote total.

Even before polls opened, the Arizona Democratic Party officials were touting turnout numbers they said would surpass the 2016 primary, when about 468,000 people voted in total. As of Tuesday morning, about 480,000 Democrats across the state had voted early, state Democratic Party chair Felecia Rotellini said.

At Faith Lutheran Church on Camelback Road in central Phoenix, a steady stream of voters filed in throughout the morning, spaced far enough apart that there were no lines. Inside, poll workers sat a few feet apart — working with precision as they handed out ballots and received them, offering voters a squirt of hand sanitizer on their way out. Workers were wiping down surfaces with cleaning wipes and other sanitizers.

For those who did not want to enter the polling station, there was a poll worker positioned outside ready to work with voters as they sat in their car, but few exercised the option in a city where there has been little outward concern about the virus in recent days. Though area store shelves have been wiped out of items like hand sanitizer and toilet paper for days, restaurants and bars have continued to see robust business, including on Tuesday — even amid increased federal calls for extreme social distancing.

Among those who voted here were Michael Fried, a 40-year-old Phoenix public school teacher who was off work after the state canceled classes statewide. He had been practicing social distancing for days, including with close friends. But Fried, who voted for former vice president Joe Biden, had forgotten to mail his ballot in and had to drop it off. “I would like to avoid getting it,” he said of coronavirus. “But what can you do?”

With voting underway, the state party put an election day update that touted the voter turnout figures and encouraged voters to “exercise caution but understand that polling centers have been properly equipped with the necessary items to ensure public safety. Election officials across the state have been working around the clock to help ensure that voting locations remain safe and accessible.”

A woman named Eileen, 70, who declined to give her last name, emerged from the polling site wearing plastic gloves, which she wiped down with a sanitizing wipe. Keeping a few feet away from a reporter, she said she had recently switched her voter registration from being a lifelong Republican to Democrat to support Biden. She wouldn’t give her last name, she said, because “I don’t want my friends to know.”"

But you probably already know that, or you’ve read similarly concerning news. In this time of social distancing and high anxiety, it can help to step back and remind ourselves of the myriad ways people are still being positive.

We asked several of our reporters to share something they saw this week that is helping them remain upbeat.

Fill out the form at the end of this article with what’s giving you hope, and we might include your example in a follow-up.

Here’s what has been keeping our reporters — and one editor — smiling:

The coronavirus feels like it has left nothing untouched in its wake, and that includes pet shelters. Fewer people are swinging by to visit available pets, and volunteers have similarly dried up. So I was heartened to see my friends take in Wyatt, a sweet pit bull mix around 2 years old. He was found starving two months ago in a Walmart parking lot in Georgia, my friend Lauren said, and she took him to her home outside New York City. She and her husband, Kris, will care for Wyatt until he is adopted and finds a forever home — a remarkably selfless decision in a period of anxiety and uncertainty. Not to mention: Lauren and Kris have done this before. Kris found Frosting, a Jack Russell and pit bull mix, running down the street in D.C. last year. That means for now, Wyatt has a friend to frolic with in the spring, now that Frosting has found a home for good.

Inside Chicago’s once-bustling Shedd Aquarium, there wasn’t a soul in sight — except for a penguin waddling past the glass tanks. With the facility closed to the public, staff at the aquarium saw an opportunity for a field trip. They started Sunday with a penguin named Wellington, who peered into one of the giant fish tanks. The next day was mated pair Edward and Annie’s turn. Video of the sightseeing trips was shared online thousands of times — and understandably so. Amid a crush of news about shuttered businesses, a crashing stock market and a growing number of infections, it was a much-needed glimpse of wonder. — Brittany Shammas

When you’re feeling anxious, pausing to appreciate the natural world can be a great way to calm the mind and relieve stress. And it can even be done in quarantine, as professional birder Nick Lund showed us over the weekend. On Sunday morning, Lund called on Twitter followers who were riding out the coronavirus at home to send in pictures of the birds in their backyards. Within hours, a virtual community of birders from around the country had snapped photos of 230 species, from bald eagles to wood ducks to painted buntings. For me, the project underscored how nature can bring people together in a frightening time. There’s something distinctly soothing about the presence of an animal — whether it’s a cardinal pecking at your feeder, a cat sitting in your lap, or, if you’re Arnold Schwarzenegger, a mini donkey and a mini horse joining you at your dinner table. Animals are innocent. They’re stoic. While our world grinds to a halt, theirs carries on. We can learn a lot from them. — Derek Hawkins

With the conversation Monday turning to the coronavirus — as it always seems to do now — one of my housemates mentioned her mother, a teacher in North Carolina. Even before school districts around the country shut down, she was worried about what the virus meant for her students: How would they all eat, when many relied on free lunches? How would they all keep learning while they were isolated in vastly different living situations? I thought of the messages that friends got from their professors as they were kicked off campuses — stressed, worried about family and in some cases scrambling for a place to go. They were thoughtful messages with parting words such as “do not hesitate to write to us for any reason” and advice to check in on vulnerable people in their lives. In all the upheaval this pandemic has brought, I’m reassured by teachers’ care for the young people who look up to them and rely on them. — Hannah Knowles

A three-tweet thread from Jester D (@JustMeTurtle) Saturday roughly did for me what watching five seasons of “The Wire” did: Remind me that every job, no matter how routine or insignificant it can feel, is essential for a functioning society. Doing it well, free of cut corners, matters. Jester wrote about being a garbageman who can’t work from home, and it resonated with others who aren’t taking days off because the world needs us. We’ve always been needed, but suddenly we felt a little more seen and appreciated. Twitter, which is often ground zero for awfulness, unspooled a thread of appreciation for the garbage collectors, delivery people, bus drivers, janitors, mailmen and so many others who, as it turns out, aren’t taken for granted. Users gave Jester more than 452,000 likes and reminders that “not all heroes wear capes.” His dose of unadulterated “we’ll get through this together” positivity stood out. — Keith McMillan

With restaurants, theaters, sporting events and other locations of social activities shut down across the United States, the abundance of time at home has been a boon for crafters. On Monday, educator Mariame Kaba asked her nearly 150,000 Twitter followers to share what they were crafting during home isolation (for Kaba: knitting a scarf). Hundreds of replies rolled in, with responders sharing their in-progress paintings, pies, woodworking, poetry, knitting and gardening. Cozy items such as crochet baby Yodas drew lots of love, as did pies with a pro-social message. While social distancing because of coronavirus is likely to last a while, Kaba’s social media callout shows that creative energy and community can still flourish amid a crisis. — Kim Bellware

"Their college year upended, Gen Z journalists keep breaking news on coronavirus (some from home)","['Brittany Shammas', 'General Assignment Reporter']","Just a few days ago, this week’s print edition was going to be a special issue on March Madness. Now, suddenly, it had turned into a special issue on a global pandemic.

AD

“I’m not sure what’s going to happen,” editor in chief Nik Popli, 20, told his staff before they signed off for the day. “None of us are. We’ll take it one week at a time. ”

AD

It was a feeling shared by budding journalists at campus news outlets across the country. As the virus sends shock waves across the globe, shuttering schools, battering the markets and compelling state governments to force businesses to close, the students have not stopped working.

Instead, they’ve diligently chronicled the impact of the virus on their communities — even as they found themselves losing advertisers, unable to access their newsrooms and unsure when, or even if, they’d be able to return to school.

AD

“In a time of uncertainty, what we can assure you of is this: The State News isn’t going anywhere,” Michigan State University senior and editor in chief Madison O’Connor wrote in a note to readers. “With the responsibility — and honor — of empowering you through credible information, we will continue to provide accurate, reliable coverage of covid-19 and its effects on our community. ”

AD

Many college newspapers are independent of the institutions they cover and are run entirely by students, meaning that the most experienced person on staff typically has four years under their belt at most. Despite being so early in their journalistic careers, college journalists across America are pulling long hours and churning out thoughtful work as their daily lives have been upended by the growing threat of the virus.

The Daily Tar Heel, the University of North Carolina’s paper, built an interactive map showing covid-19 cases across the state. The Harvard Crimson wrote about the repercussions of the school’s sudden closure for first-generation and low-income students. Ohio State University’s Daily Lantern reported on international students grappling with where to go.

AD

In some cases, student-run outlets were among the first to report infections connected to their universities. On Monday, the Eagle reported that a student living on campus had become American University’s first confirmed case. On Tuesday, the Alligator appeared to break the news that four University of Florida students had tested positive for the virus.

AD

“It really seems like all across the country, student journalists are rising to the occasion on covering something that’s just unprecedented, and something that directly affects them,” said Chuck Clark, a board member with the Associated Collegiate Press and director of student publications at Western Kentucky University.

He added: “Everything that is normal has been turned upside down in the past week, and I think that they see this as an important moment for them to make sure that they’re delivering the best coverage that they can. ”

For many student journalists, that has meant covering the news despite deciding that a print edition was no longer feasible and even as their campuses were emptying of students. Several school newspapers had started running live blogs about the virus’s implications on students and faculty. Western Kentucky’s College Heights Herald had launched an email newsletter to reach the now-scattered student body.

The websites of many student publications, meanwhile, carried editor’s letters pledging to keep readers informed.

AD

The editors of the Yale Daily News noted that the paper’s print operations had been suspended just twice before — once “when the bulk of its editors were otherwise occupied on the front lines of battle in World War I” and again during World War II, “when our building at 202 York St. was converted into a headquarters for the Navy and the Marines. ”

“The last issue of the war was printed on May 8, 1943, and the paper came back to life on Sept. 12, 1946 — with an empty bank account, no paper and a mixture of editors across class years,” continued editor in chief Sammy Westfall and managing editors Serena Cho and Asha Prihar. “Still, the paper successfully resurrected itself and eventually flourished, bringing us to where we are today. ”

Staff at several newspapers said that as students themselves, they felt uniquely situated to document the pandemic’s pervasive effect on their universities. Pointing to the slashing of staff and resources at many local newspapers, they said they also felt a strong sense of duty.

AD

“We’re doing our best to keep our audience informed because they might not have any other place to find verified information,” said Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez, editor in chief of the Daily Tar Heel. “We’re verifying and reporting the news that matters to our audience on a local level, and I think that’s the most important thing that we’ve tried to keep in mind as we’ve been working on this coronavirus story. ”

They had found no shortage of questions to answer for readers, from how federal work-study students would be affected to how students could retrieve their belongings to what their campuses looked like in the midst of historic closures. (A “ghost town,” one video put it.)

At the Alligator, Editor in Chief Christina Morales said there were signs that people were relying on the coverage. They had seen interactions with the paper’s Facebook posts leap 602 percent, she said, as page views also spiked. The editors had decided to put a reporter on call every night to watch for updates from the Florida Department of Health, some of which had been coming in about 1 a.m.

AD

AD

When one was delayed by an hour and a half, they reacted in true college student form: They tweeted a SpongeBob meme at the agency.

Waiting for the 11 a.m. coronavirus update from @HealthyFla pic.twitter.com/ObHKrIaouN — The Alligator (@TheAlligator) March 16, 2020

Unlike many of their peers, the Alligator was still putting out a print edition three days a week. After hitting the 40-minute limit for conference calls on the free version of Zoom, they planned to review the pages of the print edition using Google Hangouts.

Morales, who remained at her off-campus apartment in Gainesville, acknowledged the stress of covering a story that has direct implications on her own life. As a senior, she was reeling from the uncertainty over her commencement and the economy she would graduate into. “Should I be the hero,” she questioned, “or should I step back like everybody else?”

AD

“The fear and the panic is something that I think about,” Morales said. “I’m really scared of getting the coronavirus as much as anybody is, and we also have to go online with our classes, we also are being told to leave the area. I think it’s a really complicated position for student journalists to be in right now. ”

AD

Complicated, and to a great extent unprecedented. Even the adults in some student newsrooms, the faculty advisers, were wading into uncharted territory.

“Advisers sometimes reach into their tool bags that they have in different situations — like, I’ve spent 28 years in newsrooms around the country,” said Clark, of Western Kentucky University. “So sometimes we reach into those experiences to coach and to mentor onto how to tackle something. I don’t have anything that equals this in my bag of experiences. ”

AD

He said college media advisers were setting up a Zoom chat “to sort of talk about how things are going,” and noted that, “I kind of called it the adviser therapy group. ”

The student editors, meanwhile, had a group of their own on Slack. A week ago, as the wave of college closures began, “a lot of newspapers kind of popped on and were like, ‘What are you guys doing? We don’t know what to do,’ ” Morales said.

AD

Yet they soon seemed to hit their stride.

At the Cavalier Daily, the editors spent the week coordinating with writers from afar, covering the first case connected to the university and rattling off more story ideas. They wanted to look into the continued crowds at the campus strip the Corner, the situation inside the dormitories that remained open, the plans of college athletes.

They were also putting the finishing touches on the print edition set to come out Thursday. It could end up being “our final issue” of the semester, Popli told the staff."

Can we expedite them? An extra couple grand would be nice right about now. I should get my check first because I’m president and I’ve been working hard. Everyone else should get theirs after me. Maybe we could have a televised ceremony where I receive the check. That would boost morale, especially if I got a little more money than everybody else. Also, my kids are going to get them too, right?

A resourceful person wouldn’t even need a gun, not if they were enterprising enough to come at me with a knife, an ax, or a tire iron. At the end of the day, if you’re not willing to murder me while I’m asleep in bed and pocket all my valuables, you’re not willing to work.” Garrett went on to ask why federal funds couldn’t instead be given to the national guard, which would need to be sent in to impose martial law when the peasants began to riot.

(3:06)

As COVID-19, a strain of the coronavirus, has spread around the globe in recent months, tournaments, games and other sporting events have been canceled, while others have been modified. On Wednesday night, the NBA season was suspended, and on Thursday, the NCAA canceled all remaining spring and winter championships, including the men's and women's basketball tournaments. MLB has canceled the remainder of spring training, and Opening Day has been delayed at least two weeks. The NHL has also suspended play immediately and golf's first major tournament of the year, the Masters, has been postponed. The Boston Marathon will delay its race until Sept. 14 and the London Marathon has been postponed from April 26 to Oct. 4.

Here's a look at how the coronavirus is affecting sports in the U.S. and around the world:

The NCAA has called off its men's and women's basketball tournaments as part of a complete cancellation of all remaining spring and winter championships. The announcement is an abrupt end to a basketball season that had less than a month to go before champions were to be crowned. Here's everything we know and don't know after the cancellations, and some of the possible storylines we'll miss in the 2020 NCAA tournament. But brackets will not be released.

On what would have been Selection Sunday, in a wide-ranging interview with ESPN, NCAA president Mark Emmert detailed how the decision was ultimately made to cancel this year's NCAA tournament. Go inside the 48 hours that shutdown college sports.

In college football, Michigan and Penn State have become two of the first major programs to cancel or postpone their pro days. And Michigan and Ohio State are among the programs that have canceled their annual spring games. The SEC and ACC have also both canceled all spring football games and pro days, along with all other regular-season conference and nonconference competitions for the rest of the 2019-20 athletic year.

He suffered a toe injury and sat out the final three games.

Free-agent nose tackle Michael Pierce is close to agreeing to a three-year deal with the Minnesota Vikings, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson on Wednesday. Pierce, who turned 27 in November, went from being an undrafted rookie from Samford in 2016 to one of the top young run-stuffers in the league with the Baltimore Ravens. His 151 tackles in that span are the third most among defensive tackles in the AFC North.

The Seattle Seahawks are bringing back defensive end Bruce Irvin to help turn around one of the NFL's least productive pass-rush units from last season, he told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

ESPN Staff Writer In an expected move, the Steelers tag OLB Bud Dupree. The tag will run the Steelers an estimated $16.12M, but Dupree's tag means the team will have to part with some veterans to make room for the 27-year-old pass rusher in an already tight cap.

New England Patriots safety Devin McCourty announced the news of his own signing Sunday night, saying he is foregoing free agency to return to the team this season. The deal is for two years and $23 million, a source told ESPN.

ESPN Staff Writer The Patriots' re-signing of safety Devin McCourty, which was announced by McCourty himself, ensures that the team brings back a pillar on and off the field. McCourty, 32, is still playing at a high level, as his role in tying together communication across the secondary is critical in the team's ever-evolving defense. At a time when Tom Brady's future with the team hangs in the balance, bringing back McCourty, and also Matthew Slater, keeps two of the franchise's top all-time leaders in the fold.

ESPN The Titans have agreed to a deal with QB Ryan Tannehill a source confirmed to ESPN. Tannehill's return gives them the QB that sparked the offense last season. In Weeks 7 - 17 the Titans ranked first in yards per play (6.9) and third with 406.2 yards per game. Smith's offense scored 30.4 points per game in that stretch (3rd best) and scored touchdowns on 34% of their drives (2nd best).

Multiple team officials are skeptical that the NFL will be able to start its league year next week, expressing doubt to ESPN's Adam Schefter given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the country and the typical in-person visits, including physicals, that would have to happen as part of free agency.

The Houston Texans have signed cornerback Phillip Gaines to a one-year contract, a source confirmed to ESPN. Gaines played in six games for Houston in 2019 before injuring his ankle and missing the rest of the season.

The Washington Redskins have placed their franchise tag on guard Brandon Scherff, the team announced Saturday. There is no doubting Scherff's talent, but he has struggled to stay healthy the past two seasons, missing a combined 13 games.

ESPN Staff Writer The Redskins made it official what was long expected: They placed the franchise tag on right guard Brandon Scherff, ensuring he will stick around. They would like to work out a long-term deal and have until July 15 to do so. Multiple sources had said all offseason they would end up placing the tag on Scherff. New coach Ron Rivera has said often that he wanted to retain Scherff and free agent left guard Ereck Flowers.

Atlanta Falcons impending free-agent tight end Austin Hooper was flattered to hear about the strong interest he could draw in free agency with the new league year scheduled to begin Wednesday. The 25-year-old Hooper, a two-time Pro Bowler, should be the top tight end on the market after the Los Angeles Chargers placed the franchise tag on Hunter Henry.

The Detroit Lions re-signed long-snapper Don Muhlbach on Saturday, bringing him back for a 17th season with the club he first started playing for in 2004. Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed, but in the past few seasons, he has typically signed a minimum salary benefit contract.

The Buffalo Bills have re-signed tight end Jason Croom to a one-year contract, sources told ESPN's Field Yates. An exclusive rights free agent, Croom missed the entire 2019 season with a hamstring injury but caught 22 passes for 258 yards in 2018.

The Baltimore Ravens re-signed kick returner De'Anthony Thomas on Saturday but they'll likely bring in competition for that spot in the offseason. Thomas, 27, was an average returner who didn't make as many explosive plays as expected.

Throughout the offseason, there have been some not-so-subtle hints that the makeup of the Minnesota Vikings roster is going to experience big changes. Here's a look at the most pressing items on Minnesota's to-do list.

The Miami Dolphins have the biggest pot in the 2020 NFL free-agency pool, and they are getting ready to make a dramatic overhaul of their roster. But don't expect Miami to go on a big-fish shopping sweepstakes. Even with the NFL's most cap space, the Dolphins are approaching free agency with selective aggression.

The Indianapolis Colts have nearly $86 million in salary-cap space and players who could immediately help are available. Their $85.5 million in salary-cap space is second only to the Miami Dolphins' $88.5 million.

March 13

The New England Patriots are bringing back longtime captain Matthew Slater, with the sides agreeing to a two-year extension, sources told ESPN's Field Yates. The deal is similar to Slater's previous contract, a two-year deal that averaged $2.6 million per year. Slater, who turns 35 in September, has been the Patriots' special-teams captain every year since 2011. The eight-time Pro Bowl selection is an inspirational and spiritual leader. Coach Bill Belichick has him address players and coaches after every victory.

ESPN Staff Writer The Patriots' two-year extension with special teams captain Matthew Slater ensures that the club's inspirational leader returns, which was a top priority. Slater, 34, was scheduled to be a free agent, and his presence might take on added importance this year as the Patriots have a coaching transition on special teams with Joe Judge departing to become Giants head coach. On the field, he still commands significant attention from the opposition, even at this latter stage of his career.

The Chicago Bears signed veteran inside linebacker Danny Trevathan to a three-year extension, the team announced Friday. Chicago opted to retain Trevathan even though fellow inside linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski, 26, also is set to become an unrestricted free agent. Kwiatkoski is expected to generate substantial interest in free agency when the new NFL league year begins Wednesday.

The makeup of the Minnesota Vikings' defense changed in a major way Friday when the team announced it had terminated the contracts of cornerback Xavier Rhodes and nose tackle Linval Joseph. Five days ahead of the start of the new league year and free agency, which is set to begin at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the Vikings created significant salary cap space ($18.5 million, $22.25 million in cash) by releasing the two veteran players.

The Detroit Lions have released starting right tackle Rick Wagner with two years left on a five-year deal he signed entering 2017. Wagner was due to make $9 million in cash in 2020 and had a cap charge of $11.9 million against the salary cap. In releasing him, the Lions save $6.1 million against the cap but do take a hit of $5.8 million of dead money.

ESPN Staff Writer The Lions cutting starting RT Rick Wagner, who would have had an $11.9 million cap hit, comes in part because of his cost for 2020 and also because of their confidence in Tyrell Crosby, who was the team's swing tackle last season. It also means the team's two big 2017 free agent signings on the offensive line of T.J. Lang and Wagner are gone.

The Cincinnati Bengals and offensive tackle Cordy Glenn officially ended their tumultuous relationship on Friday. Cincinnati released Glenn, who played in six games in 2019 and was in the middle of a four-year contract worth more than $46 million that was set to expire after the 2020 season. The Bengals will gain $9.5 million in salary-cap space and will not owe Glenn any additional money.

The Los Angeles Chargers have put their franchise tag on tight end Hunter Henry, the team announced Friday. Henry, who turned 25 in December, set single-season career highs in receptions (55) and receiving yards (652) last season. The Chargers also released veteran DT Brandon Mebane and LB Thomas Davis Sr. in an effort to create room under the salary cap.

ESPN The Chargers have placed the franchise tag on TE Hunter Henry, which ensures that he will remain with the team through the 2020 season. The designation also allows for the Chargers to continue negotiating a long-term contract with Henry, who they have considered a promising tight end to replace future Hall of Fame player Antonio Gates. The franchise tag is expected to pay Henry about $11.1 million in 2020, if the two sides don't reach a long-term deal.

The Denver Broncos have used the franchise tag on safety Justin Simmons. Simmons, a third-round pick in the 2016 draft who is set to enter his fifth season, was poised to be an unrestricted free agent, but Broncos president of football operations/general manager John Elway said at the combine he would use the franchise tag to retain him if a long-term contract couldn't be reached.

The Tennessee Titans released veteran kicker Ryan Succop and tight end Delanie Walker on Friday. Releasing Succop frees up $2 million in salary-cap space but costs the team $2.1 million in dead money. Walker, 35, spent the past seven seasons with the Titans but has been limited to a total of eight games over the past two seasons because of an ankle injury and resulting complications.

The Baltimore Ravens officially put the franchise tag on outside linebacker Matthew Judon on Friday, keeping the team's top pass-rusher from hitting free agency.

ESPN Staff Writer Ravens place the franchise tag on linebacker Matthew Judon on Friday. The tag will cost between $16 million and $18 million, which will take up over half of Baltimore's projected $30 million salary cap space and limit what the team can do in free agency. Baltimore couldn't risk losing Judon. Addressing the pass rush has become an offseason priority for the Ravens after ranking 21st in the league with 37 sacks, their fewest since 2015.

The 2020 free-agent market is set to open Monday with a three-day negotiating period for players with expiring contracts. Deals can be formalized beginning Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET. Here is everything you need to know about the market, and the players available.

Tennessee could be an attractive landing spot for quarterback Tom Brady if he decides to move on as a free agent after 20 seasons with the New England Patriots. However, the Titans would not be adding the Brady of 2017 (his most recent MVP season). They would be adding the quarterback who turns 43 in August and is coming off one of his worst seasons. A closer look at his 2019 numbers shows the choice between Brady and Ryan Tannehill isn't as clear-cut as many think.

The Cleveland Browns stumbled to a 6-10 finish last season, prompting ownership to overhaul the coaching staff and front office. Here is what to watch for as the NFL's offseason calendar cranks up:

There's just a little something different in the air when it comes to the Raiders, the Las Vegas Raiders, and the start of free agency for the 2020 season. The team's move to Las Vegas has given the franchise certain lures for free agents, from state-of-the-art Allegiant Stadium, to the appeal of playing for a young team on the rise, to, wait for it, no state income tax.

March 12

The Buffalo Bills agreed to a three-year contract with offensive lineman Quinton Spain, per a league source, which ensures the team will return its entire starting offensive line in 2020. The deal is reportedly worth $15 million over those three years.

he NFL said Thursday it has ""no plans to move the start of the league year"" as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The NFL's statement comes after several teams have restricted travel for their coaches and scouts because of the virus. The Washington Redskins and New York Jets were among teams to announce Thursday they were pulling personnel off the road and sources confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday that the Philadelphia Eagles weren't sending their coaches to upcoming pro days.

The Tennessee Titans released running back Dion Lewis and linebacker Cameron Wake, the team announced Thursday, freeing up close to $10 million in cap space. Lewis signed a four-year, $19.8 million contract in 2018 and was set to hold a $5.1 million cap number in 2020. Wake signed a three-year, $23 million contract in 2019 and was set to hold a cap figure of $8.6 million in 2020.

The New England Patriots have officially exercised the 2020 option year on cornerback Jason McCourty, a source told ESPN's Field Yates on Thursday. While McCourty signed a two-year, $11 million contract last offseason, the presence of a $500,000 option bonus to activate the second year of the pact was notable.

ESPN Staff Writer With the Patriots officially picking up Jason McCourty's option Thursday, a snapshot of the cornerbacks under contract for 2020: Stephon Gilmore, J.C. Jackson, Jonathan Jones, Jason McCourty, Joejuan Williams, D'Angelo Ross, Lenzy Pipkins, Justin Bethel (special teams).

The Seattle Seahawks figure to need more than one stud pass-rusher lest they experience a repeat of 2019, when they had Jadeveon Clowney and not much else in that department. That need would be even more pronounced if they lose Jarran Reed and/or Quinton Jefferson in free agency.

Keeping Joe Mixon around for another contract, at whatever cost, could be well worth it for a Cincinnati Bengals team likely building around a rookie quarterback, assuming they select Joe Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft on April 23. Mixon's value isn't lost on Cincinnati's front office, which is already exploring the idea of giving him a new deal before the start of the season.

It appears increasingly likely Michael Brockers, who is coming off a three-year, $33.3 million extension, won't fit into the budget for the Los Angeles Rams. While the 29-year-old is expected to draw plenty of attention when he tests the market, the experience also will be accompanied by some uncertainty.

March 11

The Green Bay Packers are releasing tight end Jimmy Graham on Thursday, a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter. Graham will become an immediate free agent. Graham, who turned 33 in November, ranked as the highest-paid tight end in the NFL with an average salary of $10 million and was scheduled to take up the second-most salary cap space ($11,666,668) in 2020 of any tight end in the league.

The New England Patriots need help at tight end. And adding another receiver would be ideal. History suggests they'll cast a wide net at those positions, and others, in search of what they view as the best combination of talent and value.

The remaining cap hit depends on the outcome of the CBA vote. If a new CBA is approved for the 2020 league year, the Jets can designate him a June 1 cut and spread the hit over two years — $4M and $8M. Absent a new CBA, they get the entire hit this year —$12M. In that case, they'd save only $3M of his $15M hit. Ouch.

"Why Dak Prescott, Kyler Murray and Browns fans are happy","['Kevin Seifert', 'Jeremy Fowler', 'Jake Trotter', 'Michael Dirocco', 'Brady Henderson', 'Todd Archer', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Nfl Nation', 'Espn Staff', 'Jeff Dickerson']","Field Yates says it is good the Cowboys re-signed Amari Cooper so they can now focus on Dak Prescott and other free agents. (1:14)

The 2020 NFL free-agent market officially opened Wednesday amid one of the more unusual weeks in league history. With the rest of the sports world shut down this week due to the coronavirus outbreak, all eyes were on the NFL's annual frenzy of player movement. And the league did not disappoint.

We've seen seven teams ensure that they would have new starting quarterbacks next season -- most notably the Patriots after bidding farewell to Tom Brady -- while two others re-signed their incumbents. And it all happened amid unique rules that restricted travel and access to team facilities. As a result, many deals weren't formally announced by teams who haven't yet arranged physicals for their new players.

But our annual assessment of winners and losers pushes forward based on ESPN-confirmed reports, with six of the former and four of the latter.

Jump to: Winners | Losers

WINNERS OF FREE AGENCY

The Browns are ubiquitous members of every offseason winners list. One of these years, it will make them winners during the season, as well.

Is this the year? All we can say now is that each of their moves this week was as close to an objective upgrade as any they could have executed. No one would turn down the addition of Jack Conklin at right tackle if the other options were Chris Hubbard or Greg Robinson. It would be hard to argue that new tight end Austin Hooper doesn't bring the Browns a new dimension. And if quarterback Baker Mayfield were injured, new backup Case Keenum would give the Browns a decent chance to stay afloat.

The two biggest questions facing the Browns weren't fixable through free agency. We still can't know whether coach Kevin Stefanski can improve the team's on-field discipline. And for all the talk about Cleveland's offensive line, we won't find out for a while whether Mayfield can improve his decision-making and recognition.

But there is no doubt the Browns have a better talent at the right positions after this negotiation period.

Sometimes, heavy forays into free agency actually work. There was almost universal agreement that the Bills' 2019 spree played a significant role in clinching a wild-card spot. And after their efforts this week, the Bills might have made themselves the favorites in the new-look AFC East.

The big-ticket acquisition, of course, was landing Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs via a trade. But the Bills made plenty of other important and thoughtful moves. First, they made sure to prevent a backslide from their otherwise improved offensive line in re-signing guard Quinton Spain. Then they went hard at upgrading a defensive line already anchored by defensive tackle Ed Oliver by signing veterans Quinton Jefferson and Vernon Butler. And it's likely that coach Sean McDermott will have a better idea of how to use new Buffalo cornerback Josh Norman, dating to their time together with the Panthers.

As is the case with the Browns, free agency couldn't address the Bills' most significant question. You can't directly make quarterback Josh Allen a more consistent and accurate passer with external moves. But at the very least, another strong offensive line and an enhanced set of wide receivers can help maximize the good throws he does make.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' box office

The Buccaneers' agreement with quarterback Tom Brady will no doubt elevate their chances to make a playoff run in 2020. Their first victory, however, arrived via ticket sales. Fans rushed the team's website Tuesday night, finding themselves in a digital queue that for season tickets extended to nearly 6,000 people at some points.

To be clear, the Bucs had plenty of room for growth. Their announced home attendance ranked among the NFL's five lowest in each season of the previous decade, and in 2019, they ranked No. 30 with an average of 51,898.

Gate receipts are among the revenue sources NFL owners will share under the new collective bargaining agreement, so the Buccaneers will receive only a partial financial boost from the run on tickets. More important, though, the team is on its way to creating the kind of game-day environment it hasn't experienced in decades. Remember, the most recent playoff game the Buccaneers won was Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.

Players don't normally celebrate when they are tagged as a franchise player. The arrangement locks them into a one-year contract with no future guarantees. But assuming Prescott is taking a long-term approach, the 2016 fourth-round quarterback should be thrilled to receive the exclusive-rights tag from the Dallas Cowboys.

If nothing else, the tag puts Prescott one year closer to testing his true value on the open market. If he wanted to, he could follow in the footsteps of Kirk Cousins by playing under a tag in 2020 and 2021 -- earning close to $70 million in those two years -- and then assume that a third tag in 2022 would be cap-prohibitive.

Assuming his performance doesn't regress in the meantime, Prescott would be a 28-year-old unrestricted free-agent quarterback in 2022. Cousins was 29, with only one Pro Bowl on his résumé, when the Vikings handed him an NFL-record $84 million in full guarantees. Prescott could command much more, and if his deal is short enough, he'd get back to the table or the open market again in his early 30s.

Cousins' second deal, which he agreed to terms on this week, assured him of a $150 million haul in his first five seasons in Minnesota. Looked at one way, Prescott has taken the first step toward raking in $200 million or more between 2020 through 2024.

Murray was the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year, and his season augured great promise for his future with the Arizona Cardinals. But for Arizona to be a top-end passing offense, Murray needed a top-end threat -- and he got perhaps the NFL's best in DeAndre Hopkins.

Hopkins will help bust the Cardinals out of their plodding movement down the field. In 2019, their 217.3 passing yards per game ranked No. 24 in the league. Murray, meanwhile, averaged 7.1 yards per attempt when targeting wide receivers. That ranked No. 29 in the league.

Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury's version of the Air Raid offense leans relatively heavily on four-receiver sets. They used that formation on 328 snaps last season, more than the next five teams combined. With three other receivers on the field, Hopkins in theory could face a minimum of double-teams.

No matter how you look at it, though, an interesting offense just got more exciting.

Daniel, 33, extended an incredible and unique career arc as a quarterback who has never once competed to start but has played well enough when called upon to merit more than a decade as a backup.

After a two-year stint with the Bears, which followed time with the Saints, Chiefs and Eagles, Daniel signed a three-year deal with the Lions that would max out at $13.5 million. Assuming he makes the final roster, Daniel probably will surpass $40 million in career earnings in 2020.

In 10 NFL seasons, Daniel has made five starts and thrown a total of seven touchdown passes. Since the 1970 merger, only one NFL quarterback has managed a 10-year career with five or fewer starts, according to the Pro Football Reference database. Daniel shares that distinction with David Humm, who started one game between 1975 and 1984 while serving as the backup for the Raiders, Bills and (Baltimore) Colts.

The Lions have repeatedly denied offseason rumors that they would move on from starter Matthew Stafford, who missed eight games last season because of injury. So if all goes according to plan in Detroit, Daniel will spend another season assuring coaches that the world would not be lost if he stepped on the field.

LOSERS OF FREE AGENCY

How many times do we have to say it? You. Can't. Replicate. The. Patriots. Both the Dolphins and Lions doubled down on that fantasy this week, with dispiriting results.

The Dolphins, coached by former Patriots assistant Brian Flores, guaranteed linebacker Kyle Van Noy $30 million and also signed linebacker/fullback Elandon Roberts. They also committed $57 million in guarantees to cornerback Byron Jones, who will play alongside veteran Xavien Howard ($46 million). The team now leads the NFL in salary cap tied to the cornerback position, possibly because Flores wants to play Patriots-style man-to-man defense. Even last season, the Dolphins ranked No. 4 in the NFL by using man coverage 61% of the time, according to ESPN metrics using NFL Next Gen Stats data.

Meanwhile, the Lions -- led by two former Patriots staffers in general manager Bob Quinn and coach Matt Patricia -- guaranteed linebacker Jamie Collins $18 million, while also agreeing to terms with defensive tackle Danny Shelton and trading for defensive back Duron Harmon.

This isn't so much a comment on the players themselves, but on the cockeyed and still unproven idea that there is some kind of magic sauce that comes with someone who has been in the Patriots' program. Why can't we just acknowledge that Patriots coach Bill Belichick has built a unique set of circumstances that routinely maximizes players in ways that aren't likely to be replicated elsewhere? As a matter of team-building, giving an edge to people with a Patriots connection probably could cloud out more qualified candidates. Just stop it!

play 1:41 Was Byron Jones' decision based more on money or winning games? Field Yates and Louis Riddick applaud Byron Jones for cashing in for a lot of money and heading to Miami to join the Dolphins in free agency.

The Texans' quarterback absorbed multiple wounds this week. The biggest was the loss of DeAndre Hopkins, whom he targeted on 29% of his passes last season -- the second-highest rate of targets per total passes on any NFL team.

In a larger sense, however, it became clear that Watson is marooned on a franchise that has made a series of indefensible football decisions during the past year. Coach/general manager Bill O'Brien has dumped some of the team's best young stars, from Hopkins to Jadeveon Clowney, at fire-sale prices, all while feeding an odd obsession with aging running backs. In exchange for being one of the league's most exciting, creative and courageous players, Watson is on track to be buried under organizational dysfunction.

Three seasons into his career, Watson is eligible for a contract extension. From a business perspective, he would be wise to sit tight. If you cared about Watson, his well-being and his future, would you want him tied to the Texans for the longer than he has to be? Hashtags can be silly, but #FreeDeshaun seems appropriate.

This one is almost too easy. The Patriots' loss of Tom Brady is an event that has changed the course of NFL history. For the first time in two decades, New England isn't likely to be considered a Super Bowl contender.

A handful of NFL teams have successfully transitioned from a Hall of Fame quarterback, whether it was the 49ers from Joe Montana to Steve Young or the Packers from Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers. But nothing about the Patriots' situation, at least as of today, suggests they can match that feat. It seems much more likely that second-year player Jarrett Stidham is the guy who happened to be the backup when Brady decided to leave, rather than being a legitimate contender to take over long term.

It's always possible that Stidham could surprise us all, or that Patriots coach Bill Belichick could salvage the career of a middle-aged veteran like Andy Dalton. But from all appearances, the Patriots took more body blows this week than they had in any other three-day period in recent memory, and Belichick will have to work miracles in 2020 to overcome them.

The Bears admitted two really big mistakes this week, moving on from their top draft picks in the 2016 (linebacker Leonard Floyd) and 2017 (quarterback Mitchell Trubisky). It's better to admit mistakes than to double down on them, but it still left the Bears scrambling to find expensive replacements.

They first doled out $30 million in guarantees to lure pass-rusher Robert Quinn, who turns 30 in May and will be playing for his third team in as many seasons. And to replace Trubisky, the Bears then traded a fourth-round compensatory pick in exchange for Nick Foles, who went 0-4 as a starter for the Jaguars last season and is scheduled to earn about $16 million in 2020.

When you add those moves to the inexplicable decision to sign tight end Jimmy Graham to a two-year, $16 million deal -- one that makes you wonder if the Bears paid attention to their NFC North rivals in Green Bay last season -- you see a pretty bleak picture of desperation. You can only assume that general manager Ryan Pace won't get another chance to set the franchise on a different tack."

Grade: C+

For years, the undrafted Harris was one of the NFL's most underrated and underpaid players, thanks to a below-market extension he signed with the Broncos in December 2014. The Kansas product was able to get a raise for his final season in Denver, but Harris wasn't up to his former level of play in 2019, and that would concern me if I were a Chargers fan.

Part of Harris' value proposition in years past was his ability to play both outside and in the slot. Few corners can play both spots at a high level, but he was the exception. Last season, the Broncos imported Bryce Callahan to play in the slot, but the former Bears corner missed the entire season because of a foot injury. Despite Callahan's absence, Harris was rarely used in the slot; according to NFL Next Gen Stats, he took just 3% of his snaps in the slot, down from 52% in 2018 and 55% in 2017. Simultaneously, he allowed a passer rating of 116.3 in coverage, a dramatic rise for a guy who had not topped 71.5 in any of his three prior seasons.

There's also the reality of age. Harris turns 31 in June, and the survival rate for cornerbacks in their 30s is brutal. Take the corners who started 12 or more games in their age-30 seasons between 2000 and 2015. Just 48.5% of them started 12 or more games in their age-31 campaigns, with that number dropping to 37.5% at age 32 and a mere 20.3% at age 33. In addition, corners under 6 feet were less likely to survive each year than taller ones, and Harris is listed at 5-foot-10.

Is Harris more talented than the majority of those corners? Maybe, but even guys who were starring as they turned 30 lost the plot quickly. Nine of those 30-year-old corners made it to the Pro Bowl. Some (such as Troy Vincent and Ronde Barber) continued to play well for years to come. Others were on their way out. Darrelle Revis was a Pro Bowler for the Jets at age 30, he declined rapidly at 31, and then he was out of football, except for a brief, disastrous stint with the Chiefs. Antonio Cromartie and Tim Jennings each started one more season before their careers as regulars came to a close. Charles Tillman started one more year, missed most of two seasons due to injury and then came back for one 12-game run with the Panthers. Aaron Glenn started two more seasons and then bounced around the league for years as a veteran reserve.

It's clear that the league was concerned about Harris, given that he failed to come close to the top of the market in terms of money. I would assume that this deal is mostly or entirely guaranteed. The Chargers already have Casey Hayward outside and Desmond King in the slot, so Harris will come in as the other outside cornerback. With Hayward and Harris on the wrong side of 30, this group looks better on paper than it plays in reality.

The deal: One year, $5 million

Grade: B

The Steelers never seemed to find the best fit for Davis in his time with the team. They started him as a strong safety before moving him to free safety in 2018, and he showed promise but didn't quite make the position his own. Last year was going to be a make-or-break season for Davis, but he suffered a shoulder injury in a Week 1 loss to the Patriots, which led the Steelers to move Minkah Fitzpatrick into the role. Fitzpatrick isn't leaving for a long time.

Going after Davis makes sense for Washington, which has Landon Collins to play as a box safety and needs somebody who can play center field. It would have been a better deal if Washington could have netted at least one team option at the end, but Davis likely insisted on a one-year deal so he can reestablish his value before hitting free agency in 2020.

The deal: Two years, $17 million

Grade: C+

Joseph remained a viable starter for the Vikings until the end, though he missed three games in 2019 due to a knee injury and played just 51% of the defensive snaps, his second-lowest percentage in six seasons with Minnesota. The Vikings ranked in the top 10 against both the run and the pass by DVOA, despite mostly theoretical cornerback play, and though Joseph wasn't the primary contributor to their pass defense, he's still going to be a solid big body against the run.

The days of Joseph topping three sacks and 10 knockdowns in a season might be over, but he can offer a little more as a pocket-pusher than most run-first tackles. The Chargers will hope he ends up forming a stout pair of three-down tackles with 2019 first-round pick Jerry Tillery.

The deal: One year, $4.5 million

Grade: C+

Moved into a reserve role after the Cowboys drafted Jaylon Smith and Leighton Vander Esch, Lee is likely overqualified for his part-time position, but injury concerns and the lure of sticking with his only professional team were enough to get him to take a pay cut last year and stick around this offseason. He turns 34 this offseason and might have had a clearer path to a starting role elsewhere, but with Vander Esch recovering from neck surgery, Lee should see plenty of snaps in Dallas in 2020.

The deal: One year, $10 million

Grade: C

After the Rams acquired Dante Fowler Jr. two seasons ago and coaxed an 11.5-sack season out of the former third overall pick, they'll try to do the same thing with Floyd. The ninth overall pick in the 2016 draft, Floyd hasn't been able to make much of an impact as a pass-rusher, despite the presence of Khalil Mack on the other side of the field. Floyd's sack total has dropped each of the past three seasons, and his gangly frame doesn't make him a great run defender at the point of attack.

The Rams are betting on potential here, but the price is awfully high for a player who hasn't been a difference-maker. Floyd's deal could rise to $13 million with incentives. Even if Floyd breaks out, the Rams won't have any leverage to keep him around for years to come. This deal needed to either be for less money or have a second year attached.

Denver Broncos get: DT Jurrell Casey

Tennessee Titans get: 2020 seventh-round pick

Broncos grade: B+

Titans grade: D+

This is a straight salary dump for the Titans, who are getting the 237th pick in return for a guy who was arguably their best defensive player the past five seasons. Tennessee is going to replace Casey in its starting lineup with 2019 first-round pick Jeffery Simmons, who missed most of his rookie season because of a torn ACL but flashed during Tennessee's postseason run. The move frees up just under $10 million on the 2020 cap for the Titans.

This is an easy victory for the Broncos, whose three starters along the defensive line are all free agents. Casey isn't in the top tier of interior pass-rushers, but he's a tough two-way player who should help create pass-rushing opportunities off of stunts and twists for Von Miller and Bradley Chubb. Denver coach Vic Fangio will likely use Casey in the Akiem Hicks role, and given what lesser players are getting paid in free agency, bringing in Casey on what amounts to a three-year, $37.9 million deal with no guaranteed money is a good use of a late seventh-round pick.

The question now: What are the Titans clearing out money to do? If it's to create cash or cap space for a massive Derrick Henry extension, it's probably not going to be a great use of money. If it's for something else, we'll reevaluate this grade later.

The deal: One year, $5 million

Grade: A-

Non-tendered by the Falcons last offseason, Poole responded by turning into something truly rare by 2019 standards: a bright spot for the Jets. With Poole serving as their primary slot corner, the Jets allowed a passer rating of 87.7 to wideouts who came out of the slot or out of a tight split, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, the third-best mark in football. By comparison, they ranked 22nd in the league in passer rating on throws to receivers who were split out wide.

This is a deep draft class for competent cornerbacks (without many great ones available), but the logical entry point for Poole was going to be something close to the four-year, $36 million deal Justin Coleman signed with the Lions last season. Instead, I'm shocked that the 27-year-old Poole wasn't able to attract a significant multiyear offer. The cornerback market has been stagnant, but this is a great deal for the Jets, who get back one of the few positive contributors for another campaign on a modest deal.

The deal: Three years, $20.3 million

Grade: B-

It was a surprise when the Bucs cut McCoy last year after he made six consecutive Pro Bowls from 2012 to '17, but Tampa was better after replacing McCoy with Ndamukong Suh, and McCoy didn't have his best season in Carolina. The Oklahoma product tied his lowest totals from that Pro Bowl run in sacks (five) and knockdowns (13).

McCoy was also one of the starting defensive tackles on the league's worst run defense by DVOA. The Panthers allowed more yards per carry without him on the field, but they gave up 5.0 yards per pop with him present, and their first-down rate was higher with him on the field. I don't think McCoy was capable of single-handedly saving a decaying Panthers front, and the Bucs added other pieces, but Tampa also went from 31st in rushing DVOA to first in the league after replacing McCoy with Suh.

At this point, McCoy is going to be best as a penetrating interior disruptor who can serve as a team's secondary pass-rusher. That's exactly what he'll be in Dallas, where the Cowboys could move on from Tyrone Crawford. This is a reasonable price, though McCoy's decline over the past few seasons means the Cowboys might want to get out of this deal after one year.

The deal: Five years, $70 million

Grade: B-

Quinn had a bounce-back year in Dallas, racking up 11.5 sacks and 22 knockdowns in 14 games. By ESPN's pass rush win rate metric, though, the former Rams standout was already a superstar. He posted the league's best PRWR in 2018 and 2019 by a comfortable margin. He has won on 32.6% of his pass-rush attempts the past two seasons, and second-placed T.J. Watt is closer to 17th place than he is to Quinn in first. By another measure, Quinn has created a sack once every 22 pass-rush attempts the past two seasons, which is the fifth-best mark in football for defenders with 400 or more attempts.

Top-10 edge rusher money would put Quinn somewhere around $17 million per season, so it's clear that the league isn't valuing Quinn at the level advanced metrics indicate. Chicago general manager Ryan Pace suggested he ""wasn't a Moneyball general manager"" upon being hired, and though I'm not exactly sure what that means years later, I don't think he was relying heavily on analytics when he signed Quinn. Either way, with $30 million reportedly fully guaranteed on this contract, this isn't an enormous overpay for an edge rusher.

Of course, the Bears already have the league's largest defensive contract committed to the edge rusher on the other side of the field in Khalil Mack. Cutting Leonard Floyd created $13.2 million in cap space and made the Quinn deal work, but I wonder if this is money the Bears should have committed (at least in part) to a quarterback such as Teddy Bridgewater, a guard or one of the many cornerbacks on the market.

The deal: Three years, $30 million

Grade: C

Yet another player signing a three-year, $30 million pact, Phillips racked up 9.5 sacks in a breakout season in Buffalo. Neither the tape nor the numbers suggest that Phillips is likely to repeat that total; he finished the season with 16 knockdowns and a pass rush win rate of 10.1%, which ranked 71st in the league. ESPN's automated analysis suggests that Phillips created only five sacks, all for himself.

Even a fallback season for Phillips would help the Cardinals, who didn't get much of a pass rush from their defensive line in 2019 after Darius Philon was cut before the season. The only D-lineman who popped occasionally was Rodney Gunter, who is now a free agent. Outside linebacker Chandler Jones continues to play at a high level, but the Cardinals badly need an interior disruptor to help draw attention away from the former Patriots standout. Phillips is coming in to play that role, but I'm skeptical that he'll hit that 9.5-sack total again.

The deal: Three years, $63 million

Grade: B

It's hard not to root for the much-loved Bridgewater, who has officially come all the way back from his career-threatening knee injury to earn a starting job with another team. The Panthers are giving him $40 million guaranteed over the next two seasons and shopping Cam Newton, who will either be cut or traded. There's a chance that Carolina could draft a quarterback in 2021 if Bridgewater struggles, but for now, Teddy is the man in Carolina.

The move reunites Bridgewater with new Panthers offensive coordinator Joe Brady, who served as an offensive assistant with the Saints in 2018 before taking over as LSU's offensive coordinator last season. Brady was able to unlock something special in Joe Burrow, who turned into the presumptive first overall pick in his final season with the Tigers. Asking Bridgewater to produce one of the best seasons we've ever seen is a little much, but he could be a good fit with the offensive concepts Burrow ran in 2019.

Bridgewater's biggest strength is quickly working through his progressions to make accurate throws to open receivers. Brady had similar faith in Burrow, whom he frequently placed in empty backfields and trusted to find an open receiver before any blitz could get home. Bridgewater should get to do the same in Carolina. Of course, Burrow had one of the best receiving corps in recent memory to pluck 50/50 balls out of the air; Bridgewater isn't going to have those sort of mismatches in Carolina.

The Panthers do have receivers such as Christian McCaffrey, Curtis Samuel and DJ Moore, each of whom can make teams pay after the catch. Bridgewater's accuracy should put those receivers in positions in which they can catch balls in stride. I wouldn't expect the Panthers to be an explosive downfield attack, but they should be able to create big plays by making defenders miss in the open field.

The downside here is that Bridgewater has thrown just 221 passes the past four seasons. He was solid in winning all five of his starts with the Saints last season, but that was in about as quarterback-friendly of an offense as you can imagine, given New Orleans' playcalling and personnel. Just one of the five teams Bridgewater beat during that stretch finished in the top 10 for pass defense DVOA, and that was the eighth-placed Bears. The Carolina offensive line is also a work in progress after trading Trai Turner for Russell Okung, and the only tight end of note on the roster is Ian Thomas.

This is a good fit for both player and team. Bridgewater is now one of the few quarterbacks in the league on a middle-class deal, given that everyone else is either typically on a rookie deal or on a contract north of $25 million per season. The unique, unpredictable path he took here makes that a fair deal, and if he plays the way he did with the Saints a year ago, it could be a bargain for new coach Matt Rhule.

The deal: Five years, $53.8 million

Grade: C-

As is often the case with Jacksonville's free-agent deals, this is really a two-year contract with options. In the past, because the Jags had virtually unlimited cap space, general manager Dave Caldwell was able to give those deals out with small or nonexistent signing bonuses, which meant they were able to easily get out of their signings when overpays for guys such as Dan Skuta and Jared Odrick didn't work out. With the cap a much more pressing issue for the team these days, Schobert instead takes home a $12 million signing bonus as part of this deal, which means the Jags would owe $7.2 million in dead money if they move on from him after the season.

Two years and $22.5 million isn't a dramatic overpay for Schobert, who is the latest in the seemingly endless line of useful cover linebackers coming out of Wisconsin. In the range of linebackers getting somewhere between $10 million and $12 million per season this offseason, I'd prefer Schobert to everybody besides Cory Littleton.

My issue with this deal, instead, is that it's about the last place this team should be spending the little cap room it has left. Yes, it needs to replace Telvin Smith. For a team that is already paying Myles Jack more than $14 million per season, though, is adding a second off-the-ball linebacker on a big-money deal really the best use of resources? This is a position where teams -- including these same Jaguars under Caldwell -- can typically find useful players in the middle rounds of the draft.

This money probably should have gone to help in the secondary or a tight end or even toward a bigger deal for Teddy Bridgewater, who would have been an upgrade on Gardner Minshew. It's money the Jaguars could have pushed toward Yannick Ngakoue or a replacement in their pass-rush rotation for the frustrated franchise tagged player. This is a reasonable move for the wrong team.

The deal: Five years, $45 million

Grade: C

The Eagles have been spoiled to have Vaitai as their swing tackle the past few seasons. The TCU product was a competent left tackle while filling in for Jason Peters during Philadelphia's run to the Super Bowl in 2017, playing particularly well during the postseason. Since then, he has served as a sixth lineman and injury replacement, playing nine complete or nearly complete games in the process. He filled in for Lane Johnson over the final few weeks of 2019, when the star right tackle went down with a high ankle sprain.

Vaitai was always going to be too expensive for Philadelphia, but there was some sticker shock when his initial deal with the Lions was reported. The actual deal isn't quite as significant; Vaitai is earning $10 million per season with a couple of guaranteed years. This is a two-year, $20 million pact with options attached afterward. Vaitai will take over for the released Rick Wagner on the right side with Taylor Decker, who is soon due for a contract extension, entrenched on the left side. I thought Vaitai's big deal might come from a team that wanted to sign him to play left tackle, where players typically get paid more money.

There are three right tackles who have signed deals in this price range this offseason. Vaitai is a more promising option than George Fant (Jets), who has looked less impressive and has less experience than the Big V. At the same time, Bryan Bulaga (Chargers) has been a much more impressive NFL player than Vaitai. Although he's older and has more of an injury history, if I were Matthew Stafford, I'd much rather have Bulaga guaranteed for the next two seasons at right tackle than Vaitai.

The deal: Two years, $8 million

Grade: B

The Lions found their replacement for Damon Harrison in Shelton, who has consistently been a productive two-down nose tackle during his career. Last year was his best season, as the former Browns first-round pick was an anchor up front for the league's leading rush defense.

It's telling that Patriots coach Bill Belichick thinks he can find another nose tackle for relatively cheap and let Shelton leave at this sort of modest price, but the Lions were losing virtually all of their defensive tackles to free agency and desperately needed talent here.

After 16 seasons in Dallas, the future Hall of Famer has decided to extend his career and make a trip to Vegas to reunite with a fellow former Monday Night Football commentator in Jon Gruden. At this point, Witten's role is essentially to run short option routes, catch passes and fall down; he ranked 90th in yards after first contact and 97th in air yards per target out of 107 receivers last season.

Witten is past the point of serving as a primary tight end, but as an inline option who frees Darren Waller to move around the formation, he's a logical fit for the Raiders.

The deal: Three years, $30 million

Grade: B+

The best case for Bulaga's indirect value has been observing what happens to Aaron Rodgers when Bulaga isn't on the field. In 2019, when the right tackle played 16 games for only the third time in 10 pro seasons, he missed most of two games and parts of six others. Unsurprisingly, Rodgers' numbers fell off: The quarterback's passer rating dropped from 96.6 with Bulaga on the field to 83.8 across 101 dropbacks without him. Rodgers' sack rate was actually worse with Bulaga on the field, but he went from averaging 7.2 yards per attempt with him on the field to just 5.8 yards per throw without him. Rodgers is no fool: When Bulaga wasn't protecting him, he got the ball out more quickly.

Those seven other pro seasons are the most plausible reason the Chargers might regret this deal. Bulaga has missed 45 games in his career, including all of 2013 because of a torn ACL. He has another 13 games in which he was active and in the lineup but failed to play more than 50% of the offensive snaps, often owing to injuries prematurely ending his night. Bulaga turns 31 next week, so it's tough to imagine him getting dramatically healthier over the course of this deal, though he has missed only two full games the past two seasons.

Even given those injury concerns, though, the Chargers have to be happy with this contract. George Fant got three years and $30 million from the Jets, and he barely has 16 games' worth of experience as an NFL lineman. This is an easy win for the Chargers and a major upgrade on what was a dismal right tackle situation for Anthony Lynn's team in 2019.

The deal: Four years, $53 million

As shocking as it is to see future Hall of Famers changing teams in free agency, what might be even wilder is a rare foray into unrestricted free agency for the Bengals. Cincinnati has occasionally signed low-cost players such as A.J. Hawk or brought back cut former Bengals such as Michael Johnson, but the Bengals have generally stayed out of the upper-middle class and higher free-agent neighborhood. Perhaps buoyed by the success the Packers have had in free agency, Cincinnati actually has signings worth writing up.

Around the league, there was a lot of interest in Reader, who took over as the Texans' nose tackle for Vince Wilfork and might profile as a lesser version of the Patriots great. Nose tackles typically don't get this sort of deal, but Reader had his best season as a pass disruptor in 2019, racking up 2.5 sacks, 13 knockdowns and 6 tackles for loss. He has stayed relatively healthy, missing only three games in four seasons, and he is a logical option to line up alongside undersized penetrating tackle Geno Atkins on the interior. Reader should immediately upgrade a run defense that ranked 28th in defensive DVOA last season, though that upgrade comes at an enormous cost.

Boston has struggled to come away with multiyear deals after solid campaigns with the Chargers and Cardinals, but after making his return to the Panthers in 2019, he did enough to convince a transitioning Panthers team to keep him around. This could end up as a one-year deal in the $9.5 million range, and Boston wasn't able to make an impact as part of the league's worst run defense in 2019, but he was a competent free safety. I think he's best as a safety working his way into the box, but the Panthers used Boston almost entirely as a free safety in 2019, with Eric Reid working as their strong safety. I wonder if new coordinator Phil Snow will use the two more interchangeably in 2020.

The deal: One year, $25 million

If Tom Brady leaving the Patriots for Tampa Bay isn't weird enough, get ready for Rivers in silver and blue. I wondered whether the post-Brady Patriots might try to hijack Rivers' long-rumored move to the Colts, but the reunion between Rivers and former Chargers offensive coordinator Frank Reich just made too much sense for all parties involved. I'm a little surprised that this isn't more than a one-year pact, even if future years weren't guaranteed, but Indianapolis has the cap space to absorb a one-year deal and shouldn't have much trouble bringing Rivers back if things work out.

I'm optimistic that we'll see a better Rivers in 2020 than we did in 2019, in part because he is going from one of the league's worst offensive lines to what might arguably be one of its best. The Chargers ranked 19th in ESPN's pass block win rate metric last season, and even that was likely a product of Rivers' ability to read defenses and put his linemen in the right place. Anthony Lynn's offense was overcome by injuries up front, with veterans Russell Okung and Mike Pouncey missing a combined 21 games and never playing a snap together during the season. The Chargers had what was likely the worst tackle situation in football with Sam Tevi and Trent Scott in key roles.

The Colts ranked third in pass block win rate and did a solid job of protecting Jacoby Brissett, whose sack rate in his second run as Colts starter was nearly half of what it was the first time around. With steady, competent protection, expect Rivers to do a better job of protecting himself pre-snap and have fewer plays in which he gets blown up by a failed block attempt immediately afterward. Indy already brought back Anthony Castonzo, which should provide Rivers with one of the league's best left tackles on his blindside.

Rivers' interception rate spiked last season, but as I mentioned in my column about possible Brady replacements, a league-high seven of his 20 picks came in the final five minutes of games while his team was trailing. Those are moments when he typically had to try to put the ball into tight windows to try to make something happen. The previous season, playing on a Chargers team that often had leads in the final five minutes, Rivers threw just one pick in the final five minutes of games.

I'd also count on him playing better in front of fans who actually want to root for his team. With the Chargers forced to resort to silent counts in front of rabid fans who were cheering for the opposition in Carson, California, Rivers was 25th in passer rating at home in 2019. He was 13th in the same category on the road. In 2018, Rivers was ninth in passer rating at home and fourth on the road. I wouldn't usually put much stock in a two-year sample of home/road splits, but few teams have faced the sort of home-field disadvantage the Chargers were up against.

This move isn't without risk, of course. Rivers turns 39 in December, and you can't chalk all of his interceptions up to desperate decisions. The Chargers' offense wasn't moving the ball effectively early in games, which is why they were often trailing in the fourth quarter. It's hardly as if the Rivers-Reich partnership was a roaring success the first time around; Reich was fired after a 4-12 season in which the Chargers ranked 26th in points per game and 15th in offensive DVOA. The Colts also don't have the sort of weapons the Chargers had for Rivers and need to add at least one wide receiver to work alongside T.Y. Hilton and second-year wideout Parris Campbell.

Even given those concerns, Rivers was the best quarterback the Colts could have targeted in free agency. He should be an upgrade on Brissett. With the Jaguars rebuilding, the Titans likely to see some sort of regression from Ryan Tannehill and the Texans seemingly undergoing an existential crisis, the Colts are well-positioned to make a run at the division title if they can get their draft right.

The deal: Two years, $10 million

I've liked some of the upside shots the Dolphins have taken, particularly edge rusher Shaq Lawson, and getting Byron Jones to build the league's most imposing set of cornerbacks is a logical move at the top of the market. This, though, is a brutally bad decision. Howard is a totally reasonable one-cut back without top-end speed who doesn't offer anything in the passing game, and there are approximately 30 of those guys for NFL teams to sign at any given time. The 49ers have five of them on the roster right now. It's arguably the most fungible player type in football.

With the Dolphins still not especially close to contending, this is a position with which they should have taken one or two of their 14 draft picks and gone after somebody who could turn into a three- or four-year starter. I suspect Miami will still draft a runner, and he'll eventually take over as the starter, but every carry and practice rep the Dolphins give to Howard incurs the opportunity cost of not stumbling on a more valuable replacement at a fraction of the cost. The money isn't going to make or break the Dolphins, but this would be a short-sighted decision at the league minimum, let alone for $5 million per season.

The deal: Three years, $27 million

Grade: D+

First things first: I'm considering this grade independent of the DeAndre Hopkins trade. It isn't fair or realistic to consider Cobb as a replacement for one of the league's top receivers, though I suspect we'll all be casting Cobb in that role within the broader story of what Bill O'Brien has done to the Texans. Here, I'm trying to consider whether this signing is a good idea for the Texans with their current, post-Hopkins roster.

I still don't like this move. I can understand the logic of bringing in somebody who can work underneath as a possession receiver while Will Fuller and Kenny Stills head downfield, but Houston already has a competent slot receiver it refuses to give reps to in Keke Coutee. The Texans have two second-round picks and a third-round selection in the deepest draft class for wide receivers in recent memory. I have to imagine they could have grabbed a slot receiver with one of those selections and used this cap space more wisely.

Is Cobb really a difference-maker? This is a receiver who was able to net only a one-year, $5 million deal from the Cowboys last offseason. He had a nice bounce-back season, but it came after his receiving yards per game dropped four years in a row and fell by nearly 50% from his 2014 peak. Dak Prescott's numbers didn't budge with or without Cobb; the quarterback posted a 99.4 passer rating and a 71.6 QBR with Cobb on the field, then hit a 100.5 passer rating and 73.8 QBR without Cobb in the lineup.

At a similar price to last season's, Cobb would be a viable addition for the Texans. By handing him a contract with $18.75 million in guarantees, the Texans are buying that Cobb will improve on his 2019 numbers, if not come close to the player who was a Pro Bowler in 2014. Cobb could be the beneficiary of a lot of low-efficiency targets within this offense, but I'm not optimistic that O'Brien is using his money wisely here.

The Raiders had one of the NFL's worst linebacking corps last season. After adding Littleton and Nick Kwiatkoski, they should be competent and have the upside to be very good if Kwiatkoski lives up to his potential. I wasn't sure Kwiatkoski was enough of an upgrade to right the ship for this team on his own, but the addition of Littleton should comfortably raise the Raiders' floor on defense.

Although he was lost in the shuffle behind stars such as Aaron Donald, nobody improved more over the course of Wade Phillips' tenure with the Rams than Littleton, who made it to the Pro Bowl in his first year as a starter in 2018 and deserved to make it in 2019. Few linebackers in the league are as rangey as the Washington product, who spent time in college as an outside linebacker and edge rusher before moving inside in the pros. There's no perfect solution for covering guys such as Travis Kelce, but Littleton gives Las Vegas a fighting chance.

I'd much rather have Littleton at $12 million per season than guys such as Blake Martinez at $10 million or Danny Trevathan at $9.3 million. You might worry about whether Littleton will be able to keep this level of play up now that he has left Phillips, who is somehow still a coaching free agent, but that's a risk the Raiders are rightfully willing to take. Littleton doesn't play a key position, but he's one of the best inside linebackers in the league.

Through the end of 2019, Daniel has collected $34,309,164. He has thrown 218 regular-season pass attempts, which means he has earned something like $157,381 for every meaningful pass he has thrown at the professional level. If you prefer to go by snap, Daniel has earned $67,141 for each of his 511 NFL snaps, the majority of which have involved him handing the ball off or kneeling.

I used to think that the only thing in the way of Daniel's collecting untold millions of dollars for years to come was the possibility that he might reveal himself to be an ordinary backup quarterback who isn't worth millions. After he mostly threw checkdowns in his three starts with the Bears and went 1-2 with one of the league's best defenses, though, the Lions are giving him $4.4 million per season. It isn't even as if the Lions can pretend that he's going to mentor a young quarterback such as Mitchell Trubisky, either, given that their starter is veteran Matthew Stafford. Chase is going to continue to be on the case until he's well into his 40s.

The deal: Three years, $30.5 million

Grade: B

The rush of former Panthers to Western New York continues, as Addison joins former Panthers teammates Star Lotulelei and Josh Norman in playing for former Carolina defensive coordinator Sean McDermott. I'm not sure there is a more underrated pass-rusher in the NFL than Addison, who ranks 11th in sacks (39.5) over the past four seasons. He isn't a great run defender, but if he can approach 10 sacks as a rotational pass-rusher for $10 million, the Bills will find someone else to plug the run on early downs.

What's interesting here is that the player Addison is nominally replacing in the rotation is Shaq Lawson, whose skill set is roughly opposite that of Addison's as a player who is better against the run than the pass. It's easier to find another Lawson than it is to find a player such as Addison, and I would imagine the Bills will go after an edge-setting end to serve as their fourth defensive end in 2020.

Addison likely took a bit of a discount to play for McDermott, given how much edge rushers are being paid. That is a useful reminder of how quickly the story has flipped for Buffalo, which was once thought of as a place free agents wouldn't want to go. It's also an indicator of where the Bills are; with Tom Brady leaving the Patriots, the Bills are the favorites to win the AFC East. Spending 5% of the cap on a 32-year-old edge rusher who might play only 50% of the defensive snaps wouldn't have made sense for the Bills for much of the Brady era. Now, having rebuilt their roster and waited out the Patriots, Buffalo is rightfully in win-now mode.

Teams shouldn't rely heavily on a player's most recent game, but it can't feel good for the Giants to be signing the primary run tackler on a defense that was torn to shreds by the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. I'd pin more blame for that loss on the edge defenders and safeties of the Packers than Martinez, but you have to burn that tape if you want to feel good about your future starting linebacker.

Middle/inside linebacker has been a problem for the Giants going back seemingly to Antonio Pierce's retirement in 2009. I don't believe the Giants have had a player start more than eight games at the position in consecutive seasons over the past decade, with young players such as B.J. Goodson and Jonathan Goff and veterans such as Jon Beason and Jasper Brinkley failing to make the position their own for multiple campaigns. With Martinez getting $19 million guaranteed and $22.5 million in the first two years of his new deal, it's clear that the Giants intend on Martinez breaking that trend.

One thing's clear with Martinez: He'll pile up a lot of tackles. The only players with more solo tackles the past four seasons are Bobby Wagner and Tahir Whitehead. Those tackles might come 5 or 6 yards past the line of scrimmage, though, and Martinez has been a liability in pass coverage. The Stanford product has allowed a passer rating north of 100 in coverage each of the past two seasons. He should lock down a problem position for the Giants, but I'm not sure he makes their defense all that much better.

The deal: Two years, $50 million

I'm admittedly not always the easiest grader, but it's hard to find much wrong with bringing back a Hall of Fame quarterback on a below-market deal. This is more likely to be a one-year commitment with a voidable year to help create short-term cap space, which is just fine when you're making space for a franchise quarterback.

Brees didn't let his slow end to 2018 carry over and was excellent yet again in 2019. There's always going to be a chance that the 41-year-old will drop off in a way similar to how Tom Brady did in 2019, but the Saints rightfully are going to take another shot at a Super Bowl with Brees in the fold.

Patriots coach Bill Belichick is a magician. The Lions drafted Van Noy in the second round in 2014 and couldn't figure out what to do with him. Belichick traded a sixth-round pick for Van Noy and a seventh-rounder. (Detroit used the pick on quarterback Brad Kaaya, who didn't make it to October on their roster.) Belichick spent a half-season finding the right role for Van Noy, signed him to a two-year extension for modest money and then got three years of excellent work at a below-market rate.

Now, Belichick will likely recoup a compensatory fourth-round pick for letting Van Noy leave for the Dolphins. The Patriots have shown an ability to let linebackers leave without missing a beat, and I suspect they'll find the next Van Noy and do fine. The Dolphins were starting replacement-level players at inside linebacker for most of the season, but this is typically a position at which even bad teams can draft and develop useful contributors. The Browns, Miami's predecessors in tanking, did little player development under Sashi Brown but managed to unearth a pair of useful starters in Christian Kirksey and Joe Schobert. Cleveland also traded for Jamie Collins and signed him to a massive deal -- you can't win them all.

This isn't quite a Collins-sized deal for Van Noy, but it's a lot of money for a guy who would have probably come in closer to $10 million per year if he had been playing for a different team. This is really a one-year, $15 million deal with Van Noy's 2021 and 2022 base salaries guaranteed only for injury, which gives the Dolphins more flexibility if they want to get out of the contract. At that one-year price, though, Van Noy is basically going to have to repeat his 2019 season and produce as both a pass-rusher and a coverage linebacker. Typically, these sort of significant investments in free-agent inside linebackers turn out to be disappointing.

Most defensive tackles with a 10.5-sack, 24-knockdown season on their résumés would expect to get massive deals once they hit free agency. Reed did not, in part because of a domestic violence accusation that led the NFL to suspend the Alabama product for six games in 2019. Reed wasn't very good when he returned, as he managed only two sacks and eight knockdowns for a Seahawks team crying out for a second pass-rusher behind Jadeveon Clowney.

At 27, Reed likely took a short-term deal from the Seahawks in hopes of producing another big year before the salary cap rises dramatically in a couple of years.

The deal: Three years, $27 million

The Saints usually make a splash in free agency by adding a player nobody expects them to grab. This year, their splash might be unexpectedly keeping guys around. It's no surprise that the Saints wanted to retain Onyemata, who did a solid job of filling in for Sheldon Rankins in what was essentially a lost season for the 2016 first-round pick. Onyemata finished with three sacks and 11 knockdowns while serving as a stout defender against the run.

After Rankins struggled to return from a torn Achilles last season, it looks as if the Saints are prioritizing Onyemata's future as a centerpiece of their defensive line. Onyemata is likely to start alongside Malcom Brown in 2020, with Rankins and All-Name team member Shy Tuttle as the back half of the rotation. With the Saints' secondary in flux, retaining Onyemata to bring back a key piece of the defensive line makes plenty of sense.

Before 2019, Armstead looked like he had settled in as a run-stuffing defensive end on early downs who could occasionally move inside in passing situations with limited success. As so many players for the 49ers did on defense last season, though, he blew away whatever expectations we might have had for him. The former first-round pick went from racking up nine sacks on 1,621 defensive snaps in four seasons to generating 10 sacks on 779 snaps in 2019.

Armstead's 10 sacks came on 18 knockdowns, which suggests he was slightly lucky; typically, 18 knockdowns would generate about eight sacks. On the other hand, ESPN's pass rush win rate analysis suggests that Armstead created 11 sacks, with four of those 11 generated for other players. He moved all across the formation to create pass-rushing opportunities and beat some good players for sacks, most notably multiple-time Pro Bowler Trai Turner.

Hours after reports suggested the 49ers were close to an extension with Armstead, San Francisco shipped DeForest Buckner to the Colts for a first-round pick. Both Armstead and Sheldon Day are free agents, and with Dee Ford expected to see the field more frequently in 2020, we're going to see more of Armstead on the interior as a defensive tackle. The Oregon product will almost surely play inside on a more regular basis next season, which will hurt his value after he shifted between defensive end and defensive tackle last season.

The Armstead deal appears to be something close to a two-year, $35 million pact or a three-year, $50 million deal before the 49ers would be forced to make a serious decision about his future. To make that money work, Armstead would need to play for three more seasons like the guy who was excellent against the run and a difference-maker as a pass-rusher in 2019. Given that 2019 is an outlier in terms of Armstead's pass-rushing production, I would take the under here.

The deal: Three years, $30 million

After disappointing with the Browns, Collins made his way back to the Patriots in 2019 and was an absolute revelation. Unleashed in a role at the line of scrimmage as a pass-rusher while taking snaps as a more traditional inside linebacker, he racked up seven sacks and picked off three passes while playing 81% of the defensive snaps.

I figured that Collins and New England could come to terms and find common ground on a deal that would keep him in Foxborough at a bit of a discount. Instead, Collins found the next best thing, as he signed with former Patriots executives Bob Quinn and Matt Patricia in Detroit on a three-year, $30 million pact with $18 million guaranteed.

Outside players have seemed to get worse after joining the Lions under Patricia, which doesn't bode well for Collins' chances. The Lions need to carve out a specific role to play to his athleticism and unique instincts, and that takes work. Belichick also had a pair of linebackers who could rotate in the same role with Kyle Van Noy and Dont'a Hightower. Christian Jones and Jarrad Davis aren't the same caliber of linebacker. It would take the 2019 version of Collins to excel under this deal, and that guy didn't make the trip from the Patriots to the Browns the first time Collins hit free agency.

The deal: Five years, $100 million

Grade: B-

The two teams most impacted by the league and players agreeing to a new CBA at the last moment approached their problem in different ways. Without the ability to use both the franchise and transition tags as planned, the Titans went over the odds to lock up quarterback Ryan Tannehill, which freed up running back Derrick Henry for the franchise tag. The Cowboys went the other way, using the franchise tag on quarterback Dak Prescott and letting Cooper hit free agency unfettered.

It was a dangerous move in case Cooper was bowled over by an offer from a competitive team, but the biggest offer for the former Raiders star appeared to come from Washington, which doesn't yet know what it has in quarterback Dwayne Haskins. In the end, after all the public negotiating the Cowboys did to try to convince Prescott to take a hometown discount, it was Cooper who sacrificed by taking less money to stick around with the team.

Don't get me wrong: This is a massive deal. Cooper is only the second wideout to breach the $20 million barrier; only Julio Jones and his three-year, $66 million extension top Cooper's average annual value. When you include the two years that were left on Jones' prior extension, the Falcons star took home $87 million over five years. By overall value, Cooper now has the largest deal of any receiver.

Given that the Cowboys traded a first-round pick to acquire Cooper in fall 2018 and then rode several huge games from him to a winning streak and a division title, it's difficult to imagine that any Cooper deal would have come in much below $20 million per season. He could have signed a deal when he was initially traded to the Cowboys or before Jones signed his extension last offseason, but by waiting until Dallas had no choice but to pay up, Cooper ended up getting a top-end deal. You get the feeling Prescott might be watching with admiration.

Minnesota Vikings get: 2020 first-, fifth- and sixth-round picks, 2021 fourth-round pick

Buffalo Bills get: WR Stefon Diggs, 2020 seventh-round pick

Vikings grade: B

Bills grade: B

Bills general manager Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott have rightfully been lauded for building a selfless, winning culture over the past three seasons. The two former Panthers executives deserve plenty of credit for what they've done, but those plaudits generally ignored that the Bills nearly stepped on the land mine of 2019 with their attempt to trade for Antonio Brown. After signing Josh Norman earlier this offseason, the Bills are testing their culture's ability to absorb talent by trading for a player who was live-tweeting his desire to leave the Vikings on Monday.

In terms of the on-field fit, there are few players who make more sense for the Bills than Diggs. When you consider his toughness between the numbers and his ability to make plays downfield, he should be an ideal No. 1 wideout for Josh Allen, who had the highest off-target percentage of any quarterback in football last season and didn't do much throwing downfield. The only receivers who averaged more yards per route run in 2019 than Diggs were Michael Thomas and rookie Titans phenom A.J. Brown.

The Bills did just fine with John Brown and Cole Beasley as their top two wideouts in 2019, but the acquisition of Diggs pushes those two into more accurate roles as the second and third receivers. Buffalo suddenly has one of the best wide receiver groups in the league. The Bills were the league's seventh-most run-heavy offense in 2019, but after adding Diggs, I would expect them to throw the ball more frequently in 2020. With a solid offensive line and deep positional groups at wide receiver and tight end, Allen has everything he could ask for.

Diggs' contract is also team-friendly. The Bills will be acquiring the final four years of his extension, which have a total of $47.5 million remaining, none of which is presently guaranteed. I suspect he will start looking for a new deal as early as next offseason, especially if DeAndre Hopkins signs an extension with the Cardinals three years away from the end of his deal. The Bills should be able to get Diggs to play out the next two seasons for $23.5 million combined before looking at a new deal.

At the same time, I wonder whether the Bills and Diggs will turn out to be an amicable relationship. He was publicly frustrated by Kirk Cousins and the Vikings organization as a whole at different times over the past two seasons. Rumors of a possible Diggs trade have been circulating for more than a year, at times inspired by his missing practice. Diggs isn't Antonio Brown, and plenty of teams have taken on mercurial wideouts and reached new heights after taking that risk, but this move seems at odds with what the Bills have built. This is a worthwhile, logical risk for the Bills, but if they struggle on offense, Diggs is going to take the blame.

If the Vikings were going to move on from Diggs, this was probably the time to do so. This trade frees up $5.5 million in cap room for them to try to work on a long-term deal for safety Anthony Harris, who was unexpectedly retained with the franchise tag Monday morning. The Vikings now have two first-round picks (Nos. 22 and 25) and two third-round picks in what appears to be a deep class of wide receivers. They aren't going to pick somebody who will immediately be better than Diggs, but they are well-positioned to use one of their first-rounders or a second-rounder on a player who can step in as the No. 2 option behind Adam Thielen.

Furthermore, with the Vikings going heavy on two-tight-end sets and re-signing fullback C.J. Ham to an extension, I expect they'll go with more two-tight-end personnel in 2020 and use a second wideout less frequently than they would have with Diggs in the fold. I would argue that having Diggs on the field is better than having Ham or Irv Smith Jr., but if Mike Zimmer wants the Vikings to be a ball-control, run-first offense, it doesn't make a lot of sense for them team to pay two wideouts top-15 money. Given the public and private frustration Diggs expressed over the past two years, a fresh start probably made sense for both sides.

I can see the logic in this trade for both teams. The real losers of this trade, honestly, are the Texans. Diggs is an excellent player, and DeAndre Hopkins is a year older than his positional rival, but most onlookers would agree that Hopkins is a better player on the field and a less disruptive player off it. The Bills just sent the Vikings four picks, including a first-rounder, to acquire Diggs. Those picks are worth 21.9 points on Chase Stuart's draft value chart, which is something close to the eighth overall pick in a typical draft.

Meanwhile, the Texans netted a second-round pick from the Cardinals and swapped fourth-round selections. Even if we don't consider any time value for the Cardinals getting their fourth-round pick a year early, Houston came away with a pick in the middle of the second round for a better player and absorbed a player in David Johnson whose contract was $10 million or so underwater as part of the deal. If you thought the Odell Beckham Jr. deal was an outlier and the Texans would get a more realistic return for Hopkins, this trade proved otherwise.

The Jets desperately need offensive linemen to try to protect Sam Darnold, but I'm not entirely sure Fant is one. He is a college basketball player who took only a handful of snaps at tight end, and the Seahawks tried Fant as their starting left tackle in 2016, with middling results over 664 snaps. He then tore his ACL during the summer of 2017, with Seattle eventually acquiring Duane Brown. When Fant returned, he typically served as a sixth offensive lineman and quasi-tight end, though he was an injury replacement for two games at right tackle in 2018 and four at left tackle in 2019, including a playoff win over the Eagles.

Fant looked better at left tackle when he was filling in for Brown last season, but he's still nominally a project at tackle, and he should profile as the sort of player a team might bring in as a borderline starter or swing tackle. A desperate Jets team instead gave him $13.7 million in guarantees to start at one of their two tackle spots, likely on Darnold's blind side. There aren't many exciting options at tackle in this free-agent class, but Fant turns 28 this summer and has 16 full games under his belt at tackle, most of which weren't very good. I can understand why the Jets hope Fant will be a solid starter, but it's hard to think this secures or solves much for the Jets.

I didn't see this sort of deal coming for Glasgow, who never made a huge impression on me up front for Detroit. It looks better on closer review, however. Stats LLC credited Glasgow with zero sacks allowed in 2019, and ESPN's pass block win rate metric assigned him just two sacks. Glasgow was 24th among guards in PBWR, and he missed only two games in four seasons in Detroit. The Lions were never a good run-blocking team with Glasgow in the lineup, as they ranked 20th twice and both 31st and 32nd in Football Outsiders' Adjusted Line Yards metrics, but we can't entirely pin that on Glasgow.

Broncos offensive line coach Mike Munchak is one of the best in the business, and given how much difficulty Denver has had fixing its offensive line in years past, Glasgow could be a solid regular for the team. One of the reasons you hire Munchak, though, is the hope that he'll help you develop competent guys out of draft picks at a fraction of this cost. Glasgow has the eighth-largest average annual salary of any guard in the league on a multiyear contract, suggesting that he needs to be a Pro Bowler or something close to it to justify this deal. The Broncos probably could have used this money more to help on the defensive side of the ball.

What do you do when you get out of Joe Flacco-induced cap hell? For Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta, the answer seems to be build one of the league's most intimidating defensive lines. After trading for Calais Campbell, the Ravens added another piece up front by signing Brockers from the Rams on a deal with $21 million guaranteed. In doing so, Baltimore likely waved goodbye to former starter Michael Pierce, who seems set to leave for another team in free agency.

Pierce is an incredibly talented nose tackle, but the Ravens should be just fine in the short-term by adding Brockers and Campbell to their rotation. As is the case with Campbell and incumbent Brandon Williams, Brockers has the size and athleticism to play multiple techniques and positions along the line for the Ravens, including the nose. All three might be best at defensive end, as is the case for fellow returnee Chris Wormley, but I would expect the Ravens to draft a big body to compete with 2019 fifth-rounder Daylon Mack for those moments when a 340-pounder is needed to two-gap. Also, Brockers has missed just two games since the end of his rookie season, which can go a long way in making this type of midtier deal work.

Just when you thought general manager Howie Roseman was going to head into the market for a top-tier cornerback, the Eagles' first big splash in free agency is ... a defensive lineman. This deal contains $26 million fully guaranteed, which means the 27-year-old Hargrave will likely be with the Eagles for at least the next two seasons.

I'm not sure nose tackle was an enormous need for the Eagles or a position they needed to fill with this sort of investment. Philly was fourth in rush defense DVOA last season, despite losing Malik Jackson to a season-ending injury in Week 1. Tim Jernigan and Hassan Ridgeway were already free agents, but the Eagles have Jackson coming back alongside Fletcher Cox for 2020, and two-down nose tackles aren't usually this expensive.

Hargrave can be an impactful pass-rusher in addition to his run duties, and Jackson can take snaps outside as a defensive end, but if you had told me the Eagles were giving a defensive free agent $13 million per season, I would have guessed just about every other position on that side of the ball before landing on a nose tackle. Although I like Hargrave as a player and could see this sort of deal making sense for another team, this wasn't the best use of Philadelphia's cap space.

After he spent the early part of his Cowboys career as an inconsistent safety, Dallas moved Jones back to cornerback full-time and reaped the benefits the past two seasons. He was a revelation in 2018 and continued to play very well in 2019. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, opposing quarterbacks completed an even 50% of their passes when Jones was the nearest defender in coverage last season, which was the seventh-best mark in the league for corners with at least 250 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks mostly left Jones alone, as he was targeted on a mere 13.0% of pass attempts last season; the only corner with 250 or more coverage snaps who was targeted less frequently was the Chargers' Casey Hayward.

There are some fair quibbles. Jones didn't follow No. 1 receivers, as about one-third of his targets as the nearest defender in coverage came against the opposing team's top wideout. More than 95% of his snaps came on the right side of the defense in both 2018 and 2019. He also hasn't been a ball hawk, racking up two interceptions and three forced fumbles in five seasons with the Cowboys. Interception totals can fluctuate wildly from year to year, but the Dolphins can't count on Jones to force a half-dozen takeaways in 2020.

Of course, if Xavien Howard intercepts seven passes again, the Dolphins will be just fine with the league's most expensive cornerback duo. On one hand, signing Jones limits Howard's value. Miami moved Howard to both sides of the field during his abbreviated five-game season in 2019, often to cover the opposing team's top wide receiver. The Dolphins have to choose between playing sides, which would limit Howard's value, or moving their corners to account for matchups, which would put Jones in an unfamiliar role.

At the same time, opposing teams now can't hide their No. 1 wide receiver from a top-tier cornerback. The Dolphins aren't exactly in a division with great receiving corps -- the AFC East is currently deepest in the slot -- but it's interesting to see coach Brian Flores play things like one of the rare Patriots veterans who seems to have learned from what Bill Belichick values in New England.

Over the past decade, Belichick has repeatedly focused his investments in the secondary while letting talented edge rushers and defensive linemen leave in free agency. The names have changed over time, and Belichick's defenses haven't always been great, but he clearly espouses building from the secondary. With the NFL's two highest-paid cornerbacks, the Dolphins will hope that great coverage will form the basis of a productive defense. Given that he is a 27-year-old corner with two years of excellent football under his belt, it's no surprise that Jones just soared to the top of the cornerback market.

I'm not sure how much Graham brings to the table at this point in his career. He's one of the NFL's two or three worst blocking tight ends, so we won't bother there. As a receiver, his biggest impact with the Packers was typically on broken plays and when the other team would forget about him in coverage. The guy who used to be able to physically overwhelm defensive backs and run past linebackers wasn't really there.

For all the chatter about how Graham was going to be a devastating threat for Aaron Rodgers in the red zone, he caught eight passes there in two seasons in Green Bay, five of which went for scores. Rodgers had an 84.4 passer rating with Graham on the field in the red zone, but that mark rose to 123.6 when Graham wasn't out there.

Chicago coach Matt Nagy will presumably try to use Graham as his poor man's Travis Kelce, which might have made more sense five years ago. It's yet another attempt by general manager Ryan Pace to find a useful tight end. Pace took Adam Shaheen in the middle of the second round in the 2017 draft, but after one year, the Bears gave Trey Burton a huge contract. Both Burton and Shaheen have struggled to produce and stay healthy for any length of time, which has now led Chicago to Graham. With Graham turning 34, I'm not optimistic that he'll turn things around and justify nearly top-tier money, with $9 million in guarantees.

The Giants badly needed help at cornerback after they moved on from Eli Apple and Janoris Jenkins in consecutive seasons. The idea of going into 2020 with struggling second-year corner DeAndre Baker as their No. 1 option must have terrified general manager Dave Gettleman, so it's no surprise that he went into the free-agent market for a player he drafted when Carolina's depth chart at corner was looking bare in the spring of 2016.

Panthers fans never seemed to warm to Bradberry as a star. In part, that was because of how he arrived in the league, given that he was drafted to replace Josh Norman after Gettleman released Carolina's then-star corner from his franchise tag. Bradberry was typically solid but rarely made huge plays; he had eight interceptions in four seasons, and they generated a mere 38 return yards in the process. In a division in which the Panthers were stuck facing Michael Thomas, Julio Jones and Mike Evans six times per season, Bradberry was good enough to hold his own but not good enough to routinely shadow or shut down the best receivers in football. (To be clear: That's an unrealistic expectation.)

Although the Panthers were a mess on defense in 2019, Bradberry was their best player. Quarterbacks targeting him didn't have much fun, as he allowed a passer rating of just 73.1 on 89 targets as the closest defender in coverage. The only cornerback who was targeted more frequently than Bradberry while posting a stingier passer rating was Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore, and stars such as Marlon Humphrey and Darius Slay were in a similar ballpark.

Heavy target rates are nothing new for Bradberry. From 2016 to 2019, Bradberry was targeted 380 times as the nearest defender in coverage, more than anybody else in football. You could interpret this as a sign that opposing quarterbacks weren't afraid to target him, but the other guys just below Bradberry are considered to be among the best corners in football, including Jalen Ramsey (370 targets), Slay (342), Logan Ryan (340) and Gilmore (327).

With players typically choosing to take three-year deals in hopes of hitting the market again after the league negotiates new TV deals, Bradberry was able to come away with $32 million in guarantees and will still be able to hit the market again at 29. His $15 million average annual salary comes in just under Xavien Howard's deal, which is at the top of the market at $15.5 million, but this is a fair deal for both sides.

The primary reserve for the Bears at inside linebacker the past four seasons, Kwiatkoski filled in for an injured Danny Trevathan in 2019 and proceeded to do a worthy impersonation of the former Broncos standout. Kwiatkoski did a little bit of everything as a pass defender, chipping in with an interception, three sacks and eight tackles for loss. Chicago's defense improved its passer rating by nearly 10 points when Kwiatkowski was on the field, as opposed to Trevathan.

On the other hand, the Bears allowed 3.8 yards per carry with Trevathan on the field but 4.5 yards per carry when Kwiatkoski replaced him. Their first-down rate and successful play rate gaps were narrower, but as an undersized linebacker who was recruited to West Virginia as a safety, Kwiatkoski still profiles better against the pass than he does against the run. With the Raiders a mess at linebacker in a division in which they have to face Travis Kelce, Hunter Henry and Noah Fant, taking a shot on Kwiatkoski's range makes some sense.

The deal: Three years, $18 million

I often argue that teams should pursue backup quarterbacks who look and play like their starters. There's a little bit of Baker Mayfield in Keenum. Like Mayfield, Keenum had his success in college as an Air Raid quarterback. Like Mayfield, Keenum is undersized for the position at 6-foot-1. And like Mayfield, Keenum had a season that made the current Browns braintrust think they could go a long way with him at quarterback.

Of course, that one season -- 2017 -- is a huge outlier in Keenum's career, when he took over for an injured Sam Bradford and pushed the Vikings all the way to the NFC Championship Game. In the ensuing two years in Denver and Washington, Keenum has been stuck in bad situations. The Broncos had a terrible offensive line, and Washington saw Keenum as a stopgap after ownership decided to draft Dwayne Haskins.

Browns coach Kevin Stefanski was the quarterbacks coach in Minnesota with Keenum in 2017, so it's no surprise that the Browns targeted Keenum to serve as the backup behind Mayfield. Keenum is just good enough to give the Browns a chance to win if Mayfield gets hurt and just uninteresting enough to avoid shaking Mayfield's confidence. That's exactly the line you want to tow with your backup quarterback.

San Francisco 49ers get: 2020 first-round pick (No. 13 overall)

Indianapolis Colts get: DT DeForest Buckner

49ers grade: B-

Colts grade: C+

This is a surprising move for both sides that could end up revealing one of the biggest offseason dominoes to come. With their sacrificing their first-round pick, it's clear the Colts don't plan to go all-in to trade up and grab a quarterback in the draft. Without that 13th pick around to draft a passer, it appears likely that the Colts will pursue their much-desired addition at quarterback in free agency, with Philip Rivers the subject of most rumors. It wouldn't be shocking if this were followed by a Rivers contract in the hours or days to come.

In adding Buckner, the Colts are continuing to add pieces to a front four that general manager Chris Ballard has stocked with second-round picks. Indy was hoping low-cost veterans such as Margus Hunt and Denico Autry would serve as interior disrupters after impressing in 2018, but both players took a step backward last season, and the Colts released Hunt on Monday.

Even before the 49ers broke out on defense in 2019, Buckner emerged as a difference-maker on the interior. The former No. 7 overall pick racked up 38 knockdowns across his first two seasons, then broke out in a more traditional way with a 12-sack campaign in 2018. Buckner finished last season with only 7.5 sacks, but the Oregon product undoubtedly helped create opportunities for Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead on the edge.

Indirectly, the 49ers have chosen to retain Armstead over Buckner, with the 49ers closing in on a five-year deal for Armstead on Monday. In a vacuum, that would be a surprise; Buckner would be considered the better player and is certainly the better defender on the interior, while Armstead's success last season came as a defensive end when Dee Ford was out of the lineup. Trading Buckner and re-signing Armstead likely would lock Armstead in as a full-time defensive tackle while the Niners rotate players such as D.J. Jones alongside him.

It isn't quite that simple. It's more like choosing Armstead and a first-round pick over Buckner and the likely third- or fourth-round compensatory pick the 49ers would have received if Armstead had left in free agency. The 49ers would be able to use the 13th pick to grab a replacement for Buckner, receiver Emmanuel Sanders or a long-term replacement for offensive tackle Joe Staley. More likely, they'll use the pick to trade down and recoup some of the selections they dealt away for Ford and Sanders over the past season.

In addition, though we don't have the terms of either deal, Armstead's contract will be smaller than the massive deal Buckner appears to be getting from the Colts. Adam Schefter's report said Buckner will make $21 million per season and be the second-highest-paid defensive tackle in the league behind Aaron Donald. Buckner was under contract for one more year, but the 49ers might very well have preferred to keep Armstead and avoid devoting that sort of market-crashing deal to a defensive lineman, especially with Ford already on a big contract and Bosa's deal coming up in a couple of years.

At the same time, though, San Francisco doesn't have a replacement for Buckner. Armstead is not the same sort of player and hasn't been anywhere near as good for as long as Buckner has. It would have been reasonable for the Niners to let Armstead leave and sign a run-stopping defensive end to rotate with Ford on early downs at about half of where Armstead's deal will eventually land. There just aren't many human beings on the planet who can emulate Buckner. I wonder if the 49ers will go after someone such as Ndamukong Suh on a short-term deal to take over on the interior.

Meanwhile, as freaky as Buckner is, the Colts are giving up an enormous haul when you factor in the pick and Buckner's new contract. Defensive tackle is a spot in which teams have been able to sign players such as Suh, Gerald McCoy and Malik Jackson to more modest contracts in free agency in recent years. Buckner is excellent, but he isn't on that transcendent Donald level, and that's where his deal is going to land after you factor in the opportunity cost of trading away a first-round pick.

Regarded as the best right tackle on the market, Conklin is a free agent only because the Titans declined his fifth-year option during what was otherwise an excellent 2019 offseason from general manager Jon Robinson. You can understand what Robinson was thinking at the time. Conklin tore an ACL during the 2017 playoff loss to the Patriots, wasn't ready to start the 2018 season and was limited during a frustrating campaign before he hit injured reserve because of another knee injury.

We obviously haven't seen Conklin's imaging, but you have to figure it isn't great. Otherwise, it seems likely that the Titans would have taken the risk of picking up his option after drafting him with the No. 8 overall pick of the 2016 draft, given that teams typically retain even borderline starters. While the first-team All-Pro nod Conklin netted during his rookie season might have been generous, given how frequently the Titans handed him blocking help, he has been above average or better in three of his first four pro seasons.

Conklin is regarded as an excellent run-blocking right tackle, which shouldn't be a surprise, given Tennessee's run-heavy attack. His pass blocking is up for more debate. By Stats LLC's numbers, Conklin allowed just three sacks last season, which would be an excellent figure for a starting tackle. ESPN's pass block win rate analysis isn't quite as sanguine, ranking him 59th among NFL linemen while blaming him for 10 sacks in 2019, a far less impressive number. I would put the real number somewhere in the middle.

What was interesting about Conklin's 2019, at least as far as offensive line stances can be interesting, is that he responded to the knee injury by changing how he lined up before snaps. After lining up in a relatively traditional stance before the 2019 campaign, with a hand in the dirt and both feet facing the line of scrimmage, he came back with a totally different stance this past season. In 2019, Conklin commonly lined up standing nearly upright like a receiver, with one foot facing forward and the other facing the sideline at almost a 90-degree angle. Conklin made it work, but I wonder whether the Browns will try to get him to go back to his old stance.

The good news for Conklin is that he'll have an excellent offensive line coach in Bill Callahan, who moved to Cleveland after his time with Washington. If Conklin can stay healthy, he's also going to get another crack at free agency when things might be far more lucrative. As Schefter mentioned, we're seeing many of the free agents today take shorter-term deals in the hope of cashing in on one more contract in 2022 or 2023, after the league presumably negotiates new TV deals and the salary cap rises dramatically.

With $30 million fully guaranteed, this is a straightforward deal for the Browns, whose analytics-friendly brain trust finally erased a mistake the regime made when Sashi Brown was in charge. Those Browns let star right tackle Mitchell Schwartz leave in free agency for what ended up as a bargain deal with the Chiefs to gain a compensatory pick. Former general manager John Dorsey signed Chris Hubbard to replace Schwartz, which went disastrously. (Schwartz, of course, just won his first Super Bowl with the Chiefs.)

Now, the Browns likely will cut Hubbard to install Conklin as their starting right tackle for the next couple of years. Getting Conklin without having to guarantee three years or top Trent Brown's average annual salary is a good bit of negotiating for new GM Andrew Berry. If the Browns can land a left tackle in the draft -- they have pick No. 10 -- they'll come away from this offseason with everything that should have been on the shopping list for Baker Mayfield.

Atlanta Falcons get: TE Hayden Hurst, 2020 fourth-round pick

Baltimore Ravens get: 2020 second- and fifth-round picks

Falcons grade: C+

Ravens grade: B

While the Ravens were probably hoping for more from Hurst after former general manager Ozzie Newsome drafted him with the 25th pick of the 2018 draft, this is an exciting return for a guy who was likely third on Baltimore's tight-end depth chart. The Ravens will come away with the 55th and 157th picks in April's draft for Hurst and the 134th pick; when you consider David Johnson's contract, Baltimore almost definitely got more for Hurst than the Texans did for DeAndre Hopkins.

Hurst was a useful reserve to have in the fold behind Mark Andrews and Nick Boyle, but the Ravens will likely be able to find a feasible third tight end bouncing around free agency or somewhere in the draft. They now have extra second- and third-round picks in the draft, which is fun for a team coming off a 14-2 season and that has the reigning NFL MVP on a rookie deal.

We're only two years removed from the Ravens drafting Hurst two rounds ahead of Andrews, and while Andrews has proven to be the more valuable player, Hurst still has time to prove he's a starting-caliber tight end. He initially lost his job to Andrews in training camp in 2018 after suffering a stress fracture in his foot, and the two have been in an Andrews-heavy timeshare ever since. Andrews has played through injuries himself, which is the only reason Baltimore might have been hesitant to move on from Hurst without a significant pick being attached.

Hurst, unsurprisingly, has been more productive when Andrews has been on the sideline. Alongside Andrews on the field, Hurst has been targeted on just 16.7% of his routes and averaged a mere 1.3 yards per route run. Without Andrews in the huddle, though, he has been targeted on 23.3% of his routes and averaged 2.2 yards per route. Those marks would rank 10th and sixth in the league, respectively, among regular tight ends.

The Falcons are acquiring Hurst to serve as their replacement for Austin Hooper, who left for the Browns earlier in the day. Trading for Hurst makes some sense, given their cap restraints and that the South Carolina product is due less than $3.5 million combined over the next two years and would have a team-friendly fifth-year option available in 2023. If Hurst can be the guy we saw when Andrews wasn't on the field, the Falcons should be able to continue on offense without skipping much of a beat.

I'd have two concerns. One is that Hurst was an over-aged draftee after spending two years in the baseball minor leagues with the Pirates. He was drafted as he was about to turn 25 and will already be 27 by the time the 2020 season starts. He's actually more than a year older than Hooper, who just hit free agency. The track record of over-aged draft picks who don't immediately turn into viable starters is not great.

The other problem is that the Falcons are devoting yet another one of the precious assets they have to fixing a problem on the offensive side of the ball. The defense has been a mess for several years now, and while it's clear that they realize changes need to be made on that side of the ball, they've now devoted another high draft pick to an offensive fix. Atlanta had an extra second-round pick courtesy of the Mohamed Sanu trade, but devoting its first-round pick and both of their second-rounders to the defense wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world. As it is, the Falcons are taking a reasonable risk here to fill what was looming as a hole on their roster at tight end.

The last first-round pick of the Rex Ryan era in Buffalo and one of the few players left on the roster from the Doug Whaley days, Lawson missed a chunk of his 2016 rookie year after undergoing shoulder surgery and never seemed to get right after returning. Coach Sean McDermott & Co. then kept Lawson in a part-time role for the next two seasons before declining the Clemson product's fifth-year option. In what was expected to be a lame-duck year, Lawson emerged as a valuable rotation defender on the edge, racking up 6.5 sacks and 18 knockdowns while playing 47% of the defensive snaps under coordinator Leslie Frazier.

I'm not sure Lawson will ever hit the heights that were expected of him coming out of high school or college, but as a useful run defender on the edge who can occasionally get after the quarterback, he should be productive as a poor man's Arik Armstead. He'll make less than Armstead on this deal, but the Dolphins are still paying Lawson like they expect him to be a starter, given that this three-year deal includes $21 million guaranteed at signing and could max out at $36 million. It's similar to the deal the Dolphins handed Ereck Flowers, but Lawson has a higher floor and a higher ceiling than the offensive lineman. He'll be penciled in as a starting edge defender for the Dolphins, who rotate between three- and four-man fronts.

In a move that might bring an end to Jason Witten's storied career with the Cowboys, Dallas decided to use its free time after franchising Dak Prescott to lock up a restricted free agent. Jarwin is a high-end athlete who moved around the formation at Oklahoma State before settling in as a backup tight end. Dallas mostly keeps Jarwin as an in-line option; offensive coordinator Kellen Moore lined Jarwin up outside only 9% of the time in 2019, while 23% of his snaps (and 39% of his targets) came out of the slot.

If Jarwin can successfully move around the formation and threaten teams as a move tight end, it would help the Cowboys overcome possibly losing Amari Cooper and give Prescott an extra weapon. This deal is relatively modest and could still make sense if Jarwin ends up sticking in a secondary role, but it suggests that the Cowboys think Jarwin is capable of more. At the very least, he can stretch opposing defenses up the seam in a way that the 37-year-old Witten can't.

Quietly, the Buccaneers had one of the best defenses in all of football last season. When you account for Jameis Winston throwing pick-sixes and placing defensive coordinator Todd Bowles' unit into impossible situations, the Bucs finished the year fifth in defensive DVOA, just ahead of the Bills, Vikings and Bears. Shaq Barrett having a career year was a huge part of that turnaround, but the Buccaneers also improved after Pierre-Paul returned from suffering a broken neck during the offseason.

Their splits with and without JPP on the field were significant. The Bucs allowed opposing quarterbacks to average just 6.3 yards per attempt and post a passer rating of 83.0 with Pierre-Paul on the field, which is like facing Mason Rudolph every week. Without JPP, those numbers rose to 7.7 yards per pass and a passer rating of 97.4, which is closer to Deshaun Watson.

Unsurprisingly, the Bucs were better at getting after the quarterback with Pierre-Paul on the field. Their sack rate rose from 5.0% without JPP to 7.6% with him, while their pressure rate jumped from 24.6% to 31.6%, a significant improvement. He chipped in with 8.5 sacks and 16 knockdowns, impressive numbers for a player who played only 10 games in 2019.

Pierre-Paul's injury history is checkered. In addition to the broken neck and the famous fireworks disaster, JPP underwent back surgery early in his career with the Giants to fix a herniated disk. I'm not sure I would want to bet on the 31-year-old playing in the league five years from now, but this is a reasonable two-year pact for Tampa Bay, even if we assume most or all of it is practically guaranteed.

Even by Bill O'Brien's standards, the Cardinals and Texans made a stunning trade on Monday afternoon. Houston traded away arguably its second-most valuable player in star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, netting oft-injured running back David Johnson and a second-round pick in the process.

While I appreciate O'Brien's thoughtfulness in giving us a fascinating swap to discuss in these sport-free times, I feel for Texans fans who just lost a franchise icon in the prime of his career. Here are my thoughts on what might be the biggest trade we'll see this offseason.

Grade: C

The highest-paid player at a position isn't always the best player at the position. Heading into free agency, players like Kyle Rudolph, Trent Brown and Xavier Rhodes had the largest average annual salaries at their respective positions. Hooper is unquestionably a starting-caliber tight end, but is he close to the NFL's best tight end? He has ranked seventh among tight ends in fantasy points each of the past two seasons, which included a 16-game stint in 2018 and a 13-game run in 2019.

A significant chunk of Hooper's production over that two-year stretch has been a product of garbage time. Everyone has their own definition of what that concept means, but let's look at drives that began with a sub-10% win expectancy for the offense. Hooper has 50 catches for 522 yards and five touchdowns in those situations over the past two years; no other tight end topped 35 catches or 414 receiving yards over that same time frame in similarly desperate situations. This isn't unique to Hooper, as Julio Jones leads all wide receivers in the same category, but it's the sort of production that plays better on paper than it does in reality.

It can be difficult to parse out the impact of an individual blocker, but it doesn't appear that Hooper has made a big difference in that category for the Falcons. Over the past two years, the Falcons have averaged 4.11 yards per carry with him on the field ... and an identical 4.11 yards per carry with him on the sideline or inactive. Their first-down rate ticks up slightly, going from 24.1% with Hooper on the field to 22.5% without him.

On the other hand, the Falcons have been a much more efficient passing attack with Hooper on the field. Since 2018, Matt Ryan has posted a passer rating of 105.5 and a QBR of 68.8 with his No. 1 tight end on the field. Those marks have fallen to 86.7 and 49.8, respectively, without him in the lineup.

What was interesting about Hooper's breakout 2019 season was just how uncommon his usage rate was for a tight end. More than 50% of his receptions and receiving yards came outside of the numbers last season. Among tight ends with at least 35 catches, only three other players fit that bill: Jack Doyle and quasi-wide receivers Mike Gesicki and Jimmy Graham. Atlanta offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter loved getting the ball to Hooper in the flat, and while I don't think there's anything stopping Hooper from going over the middle -- his splits were far more typical in 2018 -- he'll likely have a more common usage pattern in Cleveland.

New Browns coach Kevin Stefanski used plenty of multiple-tight-end sets during his lone full season as the offensive coordinator with the Vikings. Minnesota went with two or more tight ends on more than 56% of its offensive snaps, the second-highest rate in football. It was in part a way to substitute for the absence of Adam Thielen, who played only 43% of the offensive snaps while struggling with a hamstring injury. Hooper's signing could serve as a way to account for the absence of Jarvis Landry, who is questionable for Week 1 after undergoing hip surgery in February. Hooper should play the Rudolph role in Stefanski's offense, with David Njoku getting his final shot with the new Cleveland regime to serve as the Irv Smith Jr.

Hooper is now getting paid like a superstar tight end. In reality, he has been something closer to a safe pair of hands. He hasn't shown any extraordinary ability to get downfield or make things happen after the catch; while Falcons fans will remember his 88-yard catch-and-run against a blown coverage in Week 1 of 2017, he has ranked 19th in air yards per attempt and 22nd in yards after catch over the past two seasons.

Unsurprisingly given the demand for tight end talent around the league and a relatively thin pool of talent in free agency and April's draft, Hooper's new deal resets what had been a stagnant tight end market. Graham had previously set the mark by averaging $10 million per season on both of his deals with the Saints and Packers, but Hooper becomes the first tight end to top $10 million per year on a multiseason pact. The Browns are paying for game-changing production, but they're more likely to get something closer to solid, steady work.

What a difference a year makes! After flaming out in spectacular fashion with the Giants and struggling with the Jaguars, Flowers got what was likely going to be his last chance to make an NFL impression with Washington. Moving inside to guard, he put together a solid if unspectacular full season at his new position. Flowers' sack and penalty numbers were both down, and he finished right next to former teammate Brandon Scherff in ESPN's pass block win rate metric at 63rd.

Flowers turned his NFL career around. Is he likely to keep that up? We can't be sure. For one, he spent 2019 learning underneath excellent offensive line coach Bill Callahan, who has a long track record of getting the most out of his charges. Callahan is now in Cleveland, and Flowers' new offensive line coach is Steve Marshall, who struggled to develop linemen during his time with the Jets. Flowers' indifference toward preparation during his time with the Giants was well-known; he can't go back to his old habits now that he has signed a multiyear deal with nearly $20 million guaranteed.

The Dolphins desperately need help just about everywhere along their offensive line, which is why I can't be enormously critical of this deal. Miami needed to add a minimum of three new starters this offseason, if not four, and Flowers will be the first of the bunch. I wonder if the team will try him out at left tackle given the need there, though the best scenario for Flowers would be to remain at guard. The Dolphins see upside here, and this deal will be fine if the Flowers from 2019 shows up and does his job, but this is a lot of guaranteed money for a player who has one year of competent play under a great coach across five pro seasons.

If 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan was licking his chops and waiting for his former Washington protégé to hit the market next offseason, the defending NFC champion coach will have to do whatever the opposite of licking his chops is for a couple of more seasons. To help create cap space for their star-laden roster, the Vikings essentially committed themselves to Cousins through the 2022 season.

The structure of this deal is what keeps the Vikings in the Cousins business. As is the case with the Ryan Tannehill extension, Cousins has his 2020 and 2021 base salaries guaranteed now, while his 2022 base salary of $35 million becomes fully guaranteed at the start of next season. The Vikings could theoretically cut Cousins next spring, but they would still owe him $56 million in guaranteed base salaries over the next two seasons. The Antonio Brown trade reset our expectations of what teams are willing to absorb in terms of dead money, but Minnesota almost certainly isn't cutting Cousins.

It's unclear whether Cousins will have a no-trade clause, as he did with his first contract. The Vikings could theoretically trade him without incurring a significant dead cap figure, at least in 2022, but Minnesota fans should prepare for three more years with him on their roster. In the end, he will take home $153 million over five years, which is a fine riposte to a Washington franchise that didn't think he was worth anything close to that.

This contract essentially keeps Cousins in the same ballpark we saw when he signed his first deal with the Vikings. At this point, it seems pretty clear that few people regard Cousins as a top-five quarterback, even if he's getting top-five money. It's also clear that he's good enough for the Vikings to win with, especially when they ramped up their play-action usage and installed a Shanahan-style rushing attack under Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak last season. Stefanski is now in Cleveland, so Kubiak will take over as the coordinator. This deal locks in a high floor for the Vikings, even if the ceiling isn't what you would hope for with this sort of money and guarantee. That's about an average deal.

The deal: Two years, $11 million

While I'm a little skeptical of the Christian Kirksey deal given positional scarcity, buying relatively low on Wagner is a reasonable Plan B if the Packers plan on letting Bryan Bulaga leave. Our Field Yates reported that this deal contains a $3.5 million signing bonus, and if there's nothing guaranteed after Year 1, this is a low-cost addition given the lack of tackles on the market and the increasing comfort teams have with giving right tackles top-tier money.

Wagner is three years removed from getting what was the market-setting deal for right tackles at five years and $47.5 million from the Lions. At that price, Wagner disappointed the Lions. Injuries impacted his play, but after allowing seven sacks across four seasons with the Ravens, Wagner allowed six sacks in 2017 and 6.5 sacks in 2018. He was 107th in ESPN's pass block win rate statistic, which credited the 30-year-old with 10 sacks allowed.

At this price tag, though, Wagner only needs to be a passable starting tackle or an above-average swing option to justify his deal. The Packers have three linemen for two guard spots with Elgton Jenkins, Lane Taylor and Billy Turner; I would expect Turner and Wagner to compete for the right tackle job in camp. Even given his decline in Detroit, Wagner should be the better option.

Brian Gutekunst signaled his plans to stay active in free agency for the third consecutive year as Packers general manager. His moves on offense (Jimmy Graham, Billy Turner) have been a mess, while the signings he made to shore up the defense (Za'Darius Smith, Preston Smith, Adrian Amos) looked brilliant until the NFC Championship Game. The Packers finished the year 15th in defensive DVOA and 23rd against the run, so after the 49ers gashed them for 285 rushing yards and four touchdowns, you would figure Gutekunst would target somebody who could help stop the league's best rushing attacks.

When he's healthy, Kirksey is capable of making a difference there. Over the past two years, the Browns were better with their starting linebacker in the lineup than they were without him. Cleveland allowed 4.6 yards per carry and a 25.9% first-down rate over that time frame with Kirksey on the field. Without him, they allowed 4.9 yards per carry and a 27.9% first-down rate. Of course, even that 4.6 yards per carry mark isn't exactly thrilling, and the success rate by expected points added (EPA) for Kirksey was virtually identical. The Browns allowed successful runs 56% of the time with him on the field and 55.7% of the time without him.

Injuries are an even bigger concern, given that he missed 23 games over the past two seasons with hamstring and pectoral injuries. Kirksey is listed at 235 pounds but might be best as a 4-3 weakside linebacker. The Packers are in a 3-4 front when they go with their base defense, which is where they're hoping Kirksey will make a difference. He'll be moving to play inside linebacker in that scheme, and while he was successful in a 3-4 base during his healthier years with the Browns, there are reasonable concerns that his body might struggle to hold up after the injuries of 2018 and 2019.

The reality is also that teams typically find early-down linebackers available for relatively cheap without having to commit $8 million per year, as the Packers did to sign Kirksey before free agency. A healthy, productive Kirksey is probably worth about this much, and we have to see how much of this deal is guaranteed, but this seems like a problem the Packers could have waited to fill with a post-June 1 cut or a draft pick. It's money I would have rather used to keep around offensive tackle Bryan Bulaga.

UPDATE: This deal actually came in as a two-year, $13 million pact with just a $4 million signing bonus guaranteed at the time of signing; I like it more for the Packers under those circumstances and have adjusted the grade.

While there were rumors that one of the organizations stocked with former Patriots coaches and executives would make a run at McCourty, the presence of twin brother Jason and coach Bill Belichick made it more likely that the 10-year veteran would return back to his only professional home. The two-time Pro Bowler was one of the best safeties in football a year ago, picking off five passes for the first time since 2012 while allowing a passer rating of just 50.6 as the nearest defender in coverage. This is hardly top-of-the-market money for a safety, so while McCourty is likely to have most or all of this deal guaranteed up front, it's a logical win-win for both sides.

One other subtle thing about this deal is the structure. McCourty was New England's second-most-pressing free agent behind Tom Brady and the only other player the team was likely to consider signing to a deal north of $10 million per year. If the Pats were desperately concerned about their cap space, they would have given McCourty a longer deal with a big signing bonus to try to create short-term cap room. By handing him a two-year deal without any extraneous years, it's possible the Patriots are confident no massive contract from another team is coming down the pike for Brady.

The deal: Three years, $36 million

Roby was impressive in a bounce-back season for the Texans last year. Playing primarily in the slot, he was Houston's best cornerback on either side of his midseason hamstring ailment. The injury cost him five games, but he came back by busting through N'Keal Harry for a pick-six of Tom Brady in Houston's 28-22 win over the Patriots on Dec. 1. A relatively abysmal Texans pass defense declined by 12.2 points of passer rating and 14.5 points of Total QBR with Roby sidelined last season. Sportradar charting suggests Roby went from allowing a passer rating of 113.8 in his final year with the Broncos down to a 79.9 mark in his debut with the Texans. That's like going from Lamar Jackson to Kyle Allen.

If we expect the Texans to keep Roby in the slot, this would be a record deal for a slot corner, after guys like Bryce Callahan, Tavon Young and Justin Coleman signed deals with average annual salaries between $7 million and $9 million a year ago. Roby hitting $12 million per year is a huge leap from that group, and the Texans are likely to be locked into Lonnie Johnson Jr. and Gareon Conley as their outside corners in 2020, which would keep Roby inside. I'd feel better if this had "
"Adam Silver lays out conditions for NBA's return, mulls charity game 'diversion'","['Tim Bontemps', 'Ramona Shelburne', 'Malika Andrews', 'Royce Young', 'Arda Ocal', 'Charlotte Gibson']","NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a SportsCenter interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols on Wednesday night that as the league attempts to navigate the coronavirus pandemic, one potential option for bringing back the sport would be some kind of charity competition -- one separate from regular play -- in order to give millions of NBA fans stuck at home something to watch.

In addition, Silver said he isn't sure what the NBA schedule will look like if play resumes this season, and isn't ready to think the league will have to cancel its season. He acknowledged the situation could lead to a complete reshaping of the NBA calendar.

In the immediate term, though, Silver said he and the league's 30 teams are weighing several scenarios for when -- and how -- the NBA can resume play whenever it is able to.

""What are the conditions we need for the league to restart? I would say I'm looking at three different things,"" Silver told Nichols. ""One is, when can we restart and operate as we've known it with 19,000 fans in buildings? ... Option two is, should we consider restarting without fans, and what would that mean? Because, presumably, if we had a group of players, and staff around them, and you could test them and follow some sort of protocol, doctors and health officials may say it's safe to play.

""A third option that we are looking at now ... the impact on the national psyche of having no sports programming on television. And one of the things we've been talking about are, are there conditions in which a group of players could compete -- maybe it's for a giant fundraiser or just the collective good of the people -- where you take a subset of players and, is there a protocol where they can be tested and quarantined and isolated in some way, and they could compete against one another?

""Because people are stuck at home, and I think they need a diversion. They need to be entertained.""

Silver said he estimates the NBA employs as many as 55,000 people -- including game-day workers at the 29 NBA arenas across the league -- and that part of his thinking is, ""How can we restart the economy? What role can the NBA play?""

""As I look at the options, maybe we can do this incrementally, and the first step isn't games with thousands of people in the arenas, but maybe it is just games,"" Silver said. ""Something I've always said is 99% of people consume our game through some sort of media platform. It's only a tiny percentage of fans who get to see our games in arenas. So those fans who watch on television or whatever device they have are fans just like people in the arena, and maybe through new kinds of technology there are ways fans can be virtual and react to plays and make noise in the arena.""

Silver also said that some of the league's recent innovations -- including the ""Elam Ending"" at last month's All-Star Game in Chicago -- open up the possibility of doing different things with the schedule under these circumstances whenever games do resume.

""I'm optimistic by nature, and I want to believe that we're going to be able to salvage at least some portions of this season,"" Silver said. ""I would say we have done new and creative things in the past, we experimented with this year's All-Star Game with a unique ending. We've talked about play-in tournaments for going into the playoffs. There may be other things we can do with the format.

""I have heard from a lot of our players ... they're going stir-crazy, they want to play, they want to compete. Players as you know, I mean, unlike a lot of us in our positions we can just go back to what we were doing, but every player is fighting something that's unwinnable, and that's the aging process. So a lost year or lost portion of a season in their careers is very different from other people, so we're gonna try by every means we can to play basketball again, but I say that the safety and health of our players is first, and our fans, which is why I don't want to speculate more on that.

""That will be the condition upon which we can play: when public health officials give us the OK.""

Silver also left the door open for the possibility that the league could see its entire calendar reshaped by current events. Some in the NBA, most notably Atlanta Hawks CEO Steve Koonin, have advocated for the league to shift its schedule from its current October-June rotation to a December-August one to avoid football, for example, and Silver said those ideas could be on the table because of the delay the league has to go through now.

""Possibly,"" he said. ""Those are things we're always talking about whether they're executives at ... ESPN or Warner Media, together with our regional sports networks. I will say that the conventional television calendar has changed so much, certainly since I got into this business. Prime time means something very different than it used to now that people in essence carry televisions around with them in their pockets.

""The summer is viewed differently than it was historically from the television standpoint, so regardless of whether we had been going through all this, it's something that the league office together with our teams has been spending a lot of time on. And we have a lot of our team owners who are technologists, media mavens by background, and so it's something that committees of owners and league officials have been working on a lot, especially over the last year or so.""

Since the NBA shut down its operations a week ago in the wake of Utah Jazz star Rudy Gobert testing positive for the coronavirus, a total of seven players -- Gobert, teammate Donovan Mitchell, Detroit Pistons center Christian Wood and four members of the Brooklyn Nets, including forward Kevin Durant -- have tested positive for COVID-19.

Silver said eight full teams have been tested so far, and that other individual players who have shown symptoms have been tested. Silver said he himself has not been tested yet. He also said that, to his knowledge, none of the seven players who have tested positive for the virus have felt serious effects to this point.

Meanwhile, in response to outside criticism of the fact NBA players have been getting tested -- including from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio -- Silver said the league has simply been following the advice of medical professionals.

""I, of course, understand [de Blasio's] point in that it's unfortunate we're at this position as a society where it's triage when it comes to testing,"" Silver said. ""And so the fundamental issue is obviously there are insufficient tests. I'd only say in the case of the NBA, we've been following the recommendations of public health officials.

""[Last week in Oklahoma City] the Utah Jazz did not ask to be tested. The Oklahoma public health official there on the spot not only required that they be tested, but they weren't allowed to leave their locker room, which was for at least four hours after the game where they had to stay, masks on, in the locker room. They couldn't leave until health authorities had tested them. So that was our first case. And then what followed, when we then had additional positive tests the next day, [we followed] health officials' and our doctors' recommendations that we then looked at essentially that group of teams that were most proximate to the initial team that had tested positive and then the circle expanded from there.

""Again, I understand from a public health standpoint why some people have reacted the way they did, but I'd say from an NBA standpoint, we were following directives.""

One thing Silver wasn't willing to do, however, was discuss what the league would do in terms of handing out end-of-season awards and honoring various accomplishments, such as who would win the NBA scoring title, if the league is unable to resume play this season.

""I'm not there yet,"" Silver said. ""We'll figure it out. I hope I'm not just in denial, but I'm just not there yet."""
"NBPA's Michele Roberts defends players, critical of government on virus testing","['Ramona Shelburne', 'Malika Andrews', 'Royce Young', 'Arda Ocal', 'Charlotte Gibson', 'Tim Bontemps']","National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts said she was ""disappointed"" in the criticism NBA teams and players have gotten for receiving access to COVID-19 tests and sounded off on who she believes is responsible for the scarcity of public tests in America: the federal government.

""There's nothing irresponsible -- if you've got that information [that you've been exposed] -- about trying to get the tests,"" Roberts told ESPN on Wednesday.

""The problem that more of us can't get the tests -- and I'm not apologetic about saying it -- in my view, that rests at the foot of the federal government. They were responsible for making sure we were protected in that regard, and I think they failed.

""We shouldn't be fighting about this now ... but once this is done and we get through it, and we will, let's figure out who screwed up and fix that.""

NBA commissioner Adam Silver told ESPN's Rachel Nichols on Wednesday that eight teams had been tested since Utah center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19, and the league suspended its season last Wednesday.

The Brooklyn Nets disclosed Tuesday that four of their players had tested positive for the virus. The Nets had not recently played the Jazz or Detroit Pistons (who have since confirmed a player tested positive) so it was not immediately clear why the Nets had all been tested.

The Nets said in a statement Wednesday that several players and staff were experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, prompting the team's traveling party to get tested for the coronavirus. The Nets said they ""sourced the tests through a private company and paid for them ourselves because we did not want to impact access to [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]'s public resources.""

De Blasio blasted the team on Twitter and suggested NBA players were being given preferential treatment because they were rich and had access to better health care than the general population, where there has been frustration over testing protocols and availability.

""We wish them a speedy recovery,"" de Blasio said in his tweet. ""But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick.""

Roberts said she understood the criticism but reiterated her criticism of how the government has handled the crisis.

""I get it,"" Roberts said. ""People should not be having to wait in line. The at-risk population should be the first to be tested. But god damn it, if the government had done what they were supposed to do, we wouldn't be competing for an opportunity to be tested.""

Roberts said that public health officials have expressed concern about infected NBA players exposing others to the virus because of the high number of players they come in contact with and how much they travel.

""We were doing games where tens of thousands of people were coming into our arenas. We were exposing potentially a lot of people to being infected,"" Roberts said. ""I get it. If you're 65 years old -- I'm 64 -- and you're symptomatic and want to get tested, it must be difficult to hear about some young'uns getting tested. I get that. And the players get that. But to the extent that there was some effort to find out just how pervasive our infection was so that people would know.

""To be perfectly candid with you, if I was at the arena in OKC when the announcement was made, when the game was canceled, I would be concerned.

""In many ways, I think it would have been irresponsible for the teams not to test their players and staffers because people in that arena have the right to know if they'd been exposed.""

Roberts said she has advised her players to report any symptoms of the virus to team officials if they come up. She is actively discouraging any stigma from being attached to players who might test positive.

""I'm distressed if any player is distressed about having his name out there,"" she said. ""There is no stigma attached to testing positive for coronavirus. I'm probably positive for coronavirus if I'm tested. Most of us will. I'm now hearing 50% of the population is probably going to be infected. We need to stop being concerned about there being some stigma about being infected -- 'Oh my God, he's got the 'rona.'

""That's nonsense to worry about that. We need to worry about how we can contain it. My message to the players is, 'Don't for one second be embarrassed about it. There's nothing embarrassing about it. This is not something that suggests you've done anything wrong. If you have it, now you know you need to be more careful in terms of your interactions.'"""

(2:27)

NEW YORK -- Several Brooklyn Nets players and staff were experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, prompting the team's traveling party to get tested for the virus, the team said in a statement Wednesday.

The statement from the Nets came on the heels of public outcry about NBA players having disproportionate access to scarce tests, when the general public -- even those who are critically ill -- are struggling to get tested.

On Wednesday night, NBA commissioner Adam Silver told ESPN's Rachel Nichols that eight full NBA teams have been tested for the coronavirus.

The Nets announced Tuesday that four of their players had tested positive for the coronavirus, including three who exhibited no symptoms.

After the Nets' announcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took aim at the NBA team's ability to get testing that has been unavailable to so many others.

""We wish them a speedy recovery. But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested,"" de Blasio tweeted Tuesday. ""Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick.""

Typically, symptoms of COVID-19 include coughing, a fever, and body aches. In some patients -- especially those who are younger -- there are no symptoms at all.

The Nets said in their statement that they ""sourced the tests through a private company and paid for them ourselves because we did not want to impact access to [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]'s public resources.""

""Using the test results, we were able to take immediate precautions and strictly isolate the players who tested positive,"" the statement continued. ""If we had waited for players to exhibit symptoms, they might have continued to pose a risk to their family, friends and the public. Our hope is that by drawing attention to the critical need for testing asymptomatic positive carriers, we can begin to contain the spread and save lives.""

President Donald Trump was asked Wednesday about asymptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting, and whether it was true that the well-connected go to the front of the line.

""Well, you'd have to ask them that question,"" Trump responded. ""No, I wouldn't say so, but perhaps that's been the story of life. That does happen on occasion. I've noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly.""

Brooklyn got its COVID-19 test results Tuesday after the team returned from San Francisco last week. The team was in the Bay Area for a now-postponed game against the Golden State Warriors on March 12.

One of the Nets who tested positive is All-Star Kevin Durant, ESPN confirmed.

On Tuesday evening, in response to the testing criticism, NBA spokesperson Mike Bass told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne that there has been worry over player contact with others.

""Public health authorities and team doctors have been concerned that, given NBA players' direct contact with each other and close interactions with the general public, in addition to their frequent travel, they could accelerate the spread of the virus,"" Bass said. ""Following two players testing positive last week, others were tested and five additional players tested positive.

""Hopefully, by these players choosing to make their test results public, they have drawn attention to the critical need for young people to follow CDC recommendations in order to protect others, particularly those with underlying health conditions and the elderly."""
"Seahawks bring back DE Bruce Irvin, acquire OT Brandon Shell","['Brady Henderson', 'Todd Archer', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Nfl Nation', 'Espn Staff', 'Jeff Dickerson', 'Michael Dirocco', 'Jenna Laine', 'Mike Reiss', 'Jamison Hensley']","Once a first-round draft pick for the Seahawks, DE Bruce Irvin rejoins Seattle as they look to beef up their pass rush. (0:36)

The Seattle Seahawks are bringing back defensive end Bruce Irvin to help turn around one of the NFL's least productive pass-rush units from last season, he told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

Terms of Irvin's deal, which was first reported by the NFL Network, were not immediately known.

Irvin, 32, tweeted his excitement about returning to the team that drafted him 15th overall in 2012.

IM SO HAPPY TO BE GOING HOME!!!! 12's I love you! — Bruce Irvin (@BIrvin_WVU11) March 18, 2020

The Seahawks also are adding more offensive-line help by agreeing to deals with tackles Brandon Shell and Cedric Ogbuehi, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter and Jordan Schultz.

Shell's deal is for two years and $11 million, a source told Schefter. The 28-year-old Shell, a fifth-round pick in 2016, started 40 games in four seasons with the New York Jets and 37 over the past three years. His addition lessens the chances of the Seahawks re-signing right tackle Germain Ifedi.

Ogbuehi, 27, was a first-round pick by the Cincinnati Bengals in 2015 and spent last season with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He's made 25 career starts but none in the past two seasons. His deal is for one year and has a max value of $3.3 million, a source told Schultz.

With Seattle signing Shell, the Seahawks and Jets effectively swapped tackles with New York signing George Fant to a three-year, $27.3 million deal.

Ifedi is one of two remaining free agents on the Seahawks' offensive line along with left guard Mike Iupati. Seattle added a potential Iupati replacement on Tuesday in ex-Steeler B.J. Finney on a two-year, $8 million deal.

Irvin signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the Carolina Panthers last season to help then-coach Ron Rivera in his switch from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defense. His ""dog mentality'' brought a needed toughness to the Panthers' defense early last season before injuries to key players took a toll.

Irvin recorded a career-best 8.5 sacks for Carolina in 13 games after missing the first three with a hamstring injury. No Seahawks defender had more than four sacks in 2019 as the team finished the regular season with only 28, tied for the second-fewest in the NFL.

The Seahawks have re-signed Jarran Reed and are trying to re-sign Jadeveon Clowney, who was their most disruptive defensive lineman last season. Seattle lost another defensive lineman, Quinton Jefferson, to the Buffalo Bills. Al Woods and Ezekiel Ansah are free agents.

Irvin won a title in the first of his two trips to the Super Bowl with Seattle and then signed as a free agent with the Oakland Raiders in 2016, after Seattle declined the fifth-year option on his rookie contract. He split time with Oakland and the Atlanta Falcons in 2018 before signing with Carolina in 2019.

Irvin has 52 career sacks, 301 tackles, 16 forced fumbles (3 recoveries) and 3 interceptions in eight NFL seasons. He also has two touchdowns.

"Ex-Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi Sworn in Amid ""Shame"" Chants In Rajya Sabha",[],"Congress has criticised Justice Ranjan Gogoi's appointment to the Rajya Sabha

Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi took oath as a member of Rajya Sabha today amid jeers and chants of ""shame"" from the Congress and other opposition parties that believe the appointment smacks of quid pro quo and severely compromises the independence of the judiciary.

All opposition parties except the Samajwadi Party walked out in protest in the middle of the oath.

""They will welcome me very soon,"" Justice Gogoi said later, unfazed by the unprecedented booing during his swearing in.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad came to Justice Gogoi's defence saying: ""Rajya Sabha has a great tradition of many eminent persons coming from diverse fields, including former Chief Justices. Justice Gogoi who has taken oath today will surely contribute his best. It was grossly unfair to do that (Congress walkout).""

The chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, said there were established rules and precedents for the appointment and the opposition was not right to behave this way.

Ranjan Gogoi, who retired as the country's top judge just four months ago, had defended taking up the role saying his presence in parliament will ""be an opportunity to project the views of the judiciary before the legislative and vice versa"".

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Mioitra said Justice Gogoi had ""absolutely no shame"" and added: ""He has denigrated the institution, he has denigrated all of India in the eyes of the world. It is shameful a person who was chief justice is selling his soul for a house in Delhi, for a Rajya Sabha seat.""

Justice Gogoi was part of many landmark judgments, including the Ayodhya verdict in which the Supreme Court handed over the disputed site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims for a Ram temple and ordered a different site for a mosque.

The Congress has called Justice Gogoi's appointment a ""serious, unprecedented and unpardonable assault"" on the basic structure of the Constitution.

""Our Constitution is based on separation of powers of the judiciary and the executive. The judiciary thrives on perception of aastha (belief) and vishwas (faith). But all of them have taken the beating,"" said Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Tuesday."
"""Ridiculous"": Karti Chidambaram Trolls Tejasvi Surya For Saying MPs Like Doctors, Soldiers",[],"""To equate MPs with emergency health workers is outright ridiculous,"" Karti Chidambaram said.

As parliament continues despite many opposition members suggesting a lockdown over coronavirus worries, the BJP's Tejasvi Surya took on the Congress on Twitter saying MPs should keep working in these times just like doctors and soldiers. The comparison is ""ridiculous"", shot back Congress MP Karti Chidambaram.

The sparring began with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor commenting on members having to sit close together in parliament despite having to advise social distancing precautions to others.

""Ironic that Members of Parliament, who must exhort their constituents to take necessary precautions against #COVID19, continue to congregate in Parliament, where they sit cheek-by-jowl on narrow benches. Far from ""practice what you preach"", MPs' msg is: ""do as I say, not as I do,"" tweeted the Kerala parliamentarian.

The BJP's Tejasvi Surya responded: ""Sir, MPs aren't special. If our doctors, healthcare workers, soldiers at borders and airport staff are functioning braving all odds, shouldn't we be doing our duties as well? Precaution is important but not panic. India under PM is setting global standards in handling #COVID19.""

To this, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram fired back: ""To equate MPs with emergency health workers is outright ridiculous. I salute the health workers for their commitment/dedication. But there is no justification for parliament to function and congregate. If everything other congregation is downsized why is parliament an exception?""

As cases of coronavirus or COVID 19 rise in the country, members have argued in parliament over whether or not to cut short the session. Parliament has been sanitized and members go through thermal screening before entering.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said representatives of the people should lead by example, referring to airline crew and armed forces working without any break to help people.

However, opposition MPs, especially the Congress, suggested the ruling BJP wanted parliament to go on so coronavirus would not be used as a reason to curtail proceedings in the Madhya Pradesh assembly, where the BJP is confident that the Congress government will fail any test of strength after the resignation of 22 MLAs."
"India Planning Rs 11,900 Crore Bailout For Airlines Hit By Virus: Report",[],"Most of the airlines have suspended their international operations. (File photo)

India is planning a rescue package worth as much as $1.6 billion (Rs 11,900 Crore) for the aviation sector, which has been battered after the coronavirus outbreak forced countries to close borders and brought air travel to a near-halt, two government sources told Reuters.

The Finance Ministry is considering a proposal that includes temporary suspension of most taxes levied on the sector, including a deferment of aviation fuel tax, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter.

The rescue package, proposed by civil aviation ministry, is likely to be worth up to 100-120 billion rupees, the two sources said. ""Taxes could be deferred till the coronavirus spread is contained and the aviation sector can come back to its feet,"" one of the sources said, adding that the companies could be permitted to pay the taxes interest-free in the next tax cycle.

The coronavirus has infected over 200,000 people and caused nearly 8,500 deaths in 164 nations, triggering emergency lockdowns and injections of cash unseen since World War Two.

In India more than 150 people have been infected and three have died.Governments the world over are scrambling to rescue airlines that have been forced to park planes and cut jobs as the virus puts the brakes on travel.

Airlines may need a bailout of more than $200 billion, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates.The Trump administration, earlier on Wednesday, sought approval from Congress for $50 billion in secured loans to US airlines to address the financial impact during the crisis.

Vistara, a joint venture of Singapore Airlines and India's Tata Group, and budget carrier GoAir have suspended their international operations.

IndiGo, country's biggest carrier, has cancelled several overseas flights and may be forced to park some planes as domestic air travel also falls.

Global aviation consultancy CAPA's India unit said that regardless of any fiscal concessions and support the government may offer, most airlines will have to shrink their operations and the more vulnerable carriers may shutdown.CAPA estimates that Indian airlines, excluding state carrier Air India, will report losses of up to $600 million for the January-March quarter, which could worsen if demand continues to fall.

""In the absence of serious and meaningful government intervention, such an outcome could lead to several Indian airlines shutting down operations by May or June due to a lack of cash,"" CAPA said in its March 18 report."
China Reports Zero New Domestic Coronavirus Cases For First Time,[],"National Health Commission said there were 34 more cases brought in from abroad.

China on Thursday marked a major milestone in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic as it recorded zero domestic infections for the first time since the outbreak emerged, but a spike in imported cases threatened its progress.

The stark reversal comes as nations across the world have shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic, with more people now infected and having died abroad than in China.

There were no new cases in Wuhan -- the central city where the virus first emerged in December -- for the first time since authorities started publishing figures in January, according to the National Health Commission.

Wuhan and its 11 million people were placed under strict quarantine on January 23, with more than 40 million other people in the rest of Hubei province entering lockdown in the following days.

The rest of China also enacted tough measures to limit public gatherings.

There were eight more deaths in China -- all in Hubei -- raising the nationwide total to 3,245, according to the commission.

There have been nearly 81,000 infections in China but only 7,263 people remain sick with the COVID-19 disease.

The global number has shot past 200,000, with more than 8,700 deaths.

On March 10, President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began and declared that the spread of the disease was ""basically curbed"".

On the same day, Hubei officials allowed people to travel within the province for the first time since January, excluding Wuhan.

On Wednesday, Hubei authorities announced they were partially opening its borders to allow healthy people from low-risk areas to leave the province if they have jobs or residences elsewhere. This also excludes Wuhan.

Life has slowly started to return to normal in the rest of the country, with people back at work, factories up and running, and schools in some regions resuming or preparing to go back to class.

Second wave

But there is concern about a second wave of infections due to an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day.

Beijing and other regions are now requiring most international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels.

The National Health Commission said there were 34 more cases brought in from abroad, the biggest daily increase in two weeks, with 189 in total now.

""We should never allow the hard-won and continuous positive trend to be reversed,"" Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on Wednesday.

The disease is believed to have jumped from an animal to humans at a market that illegally sold wild game in Wuhan late last year.

There have also been questions about China's official figures, as authorities changed its methodology to count infections, and the government has endured rare public criticism of its handling of the health emergency.

Local officials initially attempted to cover up the outbreak, with police silencing doctors who had raised the alarm about the emergence of the new virus as early as December.

One of the whistleblowers, Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, died from the virus himself in February, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger on social media.

The first case emerged in Wuhan on December 1, according to Chinese researchers, but it was not until January 9 the country confirmed a ""new type of coronavirus"".

Between January 5 and 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, even as Japan and Thailand declared first infections -- a period that coincided with annual political meetings in Wuhan and Hubei province.

"IndiGo, Vistara May Ground Jets As India Fights Coronavirus: Report",[],"IndiGo, Vistara are considering grounding planes as the coronavirus ravages travel demand.

Two of India's most high-profile airlines are considering grounding planes as the coronavirus ravages travel demand, people familiar with the matter said.

IndiGo, Asia's biggest budget airline by market value, has seen traffic slump as much as 30% in India, while its international flights have dried up following government restrictions on travel, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations aren't public. In addition to potential groundings, Vistara, the Indian venture of Singapore Airlines Ltd., is considering delaying delivery of some of the first batch of Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliners it has on order, another person said.

Should the pair go ahead with the flight cancellations, they'd join the growing number of airlines around the world doing so - United Airlines Holdings Inc. and British Airways's parent recently announced capacity cuts - as the pandemic keeps people from flying. Indian carriers had so far avoided major reductions in flights but pressure is mounting as the number of confirmed cases keeps climbing in the world's second-most populous country.

Industry groups and analysts have issued dire warnings about the virus, with Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation saying that most of the world's airlines could go bankrupt by the end of May unless authorities step in. The International Air Transport Association said Tuesday that the global airline industry needs as much as $200 billion in government aid and bailout measures to survive the crisis.

With demand expected to fall at least 40-50% in the near term, India's airlines may initially ground 150 aircraft, the local unit of CAPA said Wednesday. Even after a slump oil prices, the country's airlines will lose $500-$600 million this quarter, excluding loss-making national carrier Air India Ltd., and that estimate may be revised downward.

""In the absence of a serious and meaningful government intervention, such an outcome could lead to several Indian airlines shutting down operations by May or June due to a lack of cash,"" CAPA India said in a report. ""Regardless of any fiscal concessions and support that the government may offer, most airlines will have to shrink their operations, and the more vulnerable carriers may shutdown.""

Both IndiGo and Vistara have yet to make final decisions on their plans to combat plummeting demand, the people said. Representatives from InterGlobe Aviation Ltd.'s IndiGo, which last week said its quarterly results would be materially impacted by the virus, declined to comment. Vistara, which is 51% owned by the Tata Group, said it wouldn't comment on speculation.

InterGlobe shares fell 2.7% Wednesday, taking their loss since Feb. 18 to 35%.

Go Airlines India Ltd. also canceled several domestic flights on Wednesday after suspending international routes, airport websites showed. Representatives at the airline didn't respond to requests for comment.

Air-passenger traffic in India, one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, rose 9% in February, data from the country's aviation regulator showed Wednesday. While travel restrictions were being imposed elsewhere, particularly around China, India was largely unaffected last month, before the recent sharp escalation in travel bans globally.

Amazon Faces New Role In Virus Crisis: Lifeline,[],"Amazon is changing its priorities to household items and medical supply.

Amazon is finding itself in a new role in the coronavirus crisis as hunkered-down consumers increasingly turn to the tech giant for anything from toilet tissue to streaming television.

The massive infrastructure Amazon has spent years building warehouses, distribution, delivery and cloud computing has vaulted the company into a critical role in the crisis.

In a time when many are confined to their homes, consumers will have high expectations that Amazon will come though to meet their needs and demands.

Amazon, which has expanded its food operations with the acquisition of the Whole Foods grocery chain, has shifted its priorities in recent days to help people get needed household basics and medical supplies.

""There's enormous pressure on Amazon to meet these increased expectations,"" said Technalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell.

""Fairly or unfairly, people will expect that Amazon will always have some things, like toilet paper. If not, they're going to catch more grief than if a local grocery store is out.""

Amazon this week boosted pay and set out to hire 100,000 more US workers to add to its global workforce of some 800,000 to cope with a surge in online shopping prompted by coronavirus fears.

The Seattle-based firm expects to spend more than $350 million to bump up hourly pay in the North America and Europe for employees and partners in distribution centers, transportation operations and stores.

""Getting a priority item to your doorstep is vital as communities practice social-distancing, particularly for the elderly and others with underlying health issues,"" senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark said in a blog post.

""We are seeing a significant increase in demand, which means our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year.""

Looking for a hero

Amazon accounts for some 37 percent of US e-commerce sales, according to the research firm eMarketer, and is the largest cloud computing firm which powers online operations around the world, including for firms like rival streaming platform Netflix.

If Amazon becomes a salvation for people unable or afraid to go out to shops due to coronavirus risk, it could win new users and become a more entrenched habit, and potentially boost its image at a time when Big Tech has come under fire.

""Worst case, Amazon gets looked at as the company that had to shut down like other retailers (due to the coronavirus),"" said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy.

""Best case, they look like a hero.""

Moorhead used Amazon to deliver groceries to his octogenarian father ensconced at home, and to his in-laws, seniors ""hiding out"" in a lakeside house.

Amazon this week said it was reorganizing its operations, slowing down some deliveries to help people with more pressing needs.

""We are seeing increased online shopping and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock,"" Amazon said in response to an AFP inquiry.

""With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so we can more quickly receive, restock and ship these products to customers.""

Amazon has also been forced into policing the platform to thwart price-gouging efforts by vendors who stockpiled coveted supplies like breathing masks and hand sanitizers.

""It looks like Amazon is shutting most of them down, and doing it in a very visible fashion to send a message to others about gouging,"" Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said.

Risks ahead

Amazon's vulnerability is in its delivery network, some of which it contracts out to partners, according to Enderle.

""Once drivers start being sick, we could have a problem,"" Enderle said.

""They are a serious liability that could cripple Amazon.""

Drivers exposed to the virus could become carriers, taking it with them on their routes, Enderle reasoned, noting he was handed a package a day earlier by delivery driver not wearing any gear to protect from the virus.

Amazon has also faced criticism for keeping warehouses open in Europe even after cases of COVID-19 have been detected among workers.

The French branch of the activist group Friends of the Earth called Amazon's actions irresponsible and said in a statement the company ""is seeking to profit from the crisis by increasing its influence.""

A side effect of the coronavirus could be accelerated development of drone delivery mechanisms already being tested in some locations, according to Enderle."
"""Tough Decisions Necessary"": IndiGo Writes To Pilots Amid Coronavirus",[],"Coronavirus: IndiGo's flight operations chief Ashim Mitra wrote an e-mail to pilots this morning

Economic environment in aviation sector has deteriorated significantly and it has become necessary to initiate some tough decisions over the next few days and weeks, said IndiGo's flight operations chief Ashim Mitra to pilots in an email this morning.

With countries sealing their borders partially or fully across the world due to the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus pandemic, the aviation sector has been hit extremely hard as most airlines globally have drastically curtailed their flight operations.

Mr Mitra stated in his email: ""Economic environment has deteriorated significantly and no airline is insulated from this severe downturn.""

""It has become a necessity to initiate some tough calls and we are working on a string of measures that will be shared and implemented over the next few days and weeks,"" Mr Mitra said.

Asking the pilots to not believe any hearsay, Mr Mitra added that the airline will keep them updated.

""Please keep taking all the precautions against COVID-19 and we shall overcome any challenge as long as we stand strong and tall against these headwinds,"" he said.

GoAir on Wednesday said it has terminated contracts of expat pilots amid curtailed operations due to the pandemic.

Citing ""unprecedented"" decline in air travel, the budget carrier announced it was suspending international operations and offering leave without pay programme to its staff on a rotational basis."
"""Hanging Nirbhaya Convicts Won't Bring Justice"": Ex-Judge Kurian Joseph",[],"Justice Joseph said he don't think that by hanging convicts, parents of Nirbhaya will get justice (File)

The hanging of the four men convicted of the 2012 gang-rape of Nirbhaya will not bring justice to her parents, former Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph said on Wednesday, two days before their scheduled execution. Justice Joseph questioned whether such crimes would stop with this hanging.

""By hanging these people, will such type of crimes stop? In Bachan Singh case, Supreme Court had said that the death penalty can be handed over in rarest of the rare cases, and that too, only when all other options are unquestionably foreclosed,"" the retired Supreme Court judge told news agency ANI.

Justice does not mean life for a life; the absence of freedom is the worst that a person can have, said the ex-judge.

He said if people were sent to jail for life, society could be told that this would be their fate for such crimes. On the other hand, if they were executed, the crime was forgotten.

After three previous dates of hanging passed, Akshay Thakur, 31, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Mukesh Singh, 32, are expected to be hanged at 5.30 am on Friday. They have not stopped filing petitions to stall the execution once again.

""I don't think that by hanging the four convicts the parents of Nirbhaya will get justice. I have all sympathies definitely for the parents of the victim. I really feel sorry,"" retired Justice Joseph said.

""Gandhi Ji had said that an eye for eye will only make the world blind. So in criminal justice procedure, there is nothing called vengeance. If I take your life that means you will take mine. This is not justice. Vengeance and retribution are two different concepts altogether,"" he added.

The purpose of punishment is retribution, restitution and reformation, he said.

""According to me even if the court has left out considering any of these aspects at the time of the considering the mercy petition, the president and the government also have a duty to take into account some of these aspects,"" he said.

On December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old was brutally assaulted and tortured in a moving bus and dumped on the road, by six people including a juvenile. The woman died a few days later.

Sources said the participants at the meeting discussed ways to further strengthen the preparedness against the virus. The plans discussed included further enhancing testing facilities.



Though initially reluctant to involve private laboratories, the government has been considering roping them in. The Health ministry yesterday said it was an ""evolving situation"" and while taking all precautions, it is also trying to be prepared for every eventuality.

Indian Council of Medical Research, the nodal agency for battling the virus, is in talks with private laboratories.

The government is also trying to get across the message of social distancing - seen as the only way of breaking the viral chain of transmission.

Over the last weeks, various state governments have shut down educational institutions. Malls and multiplexes, cancelled sports gatherings and functions and urged people not to travel. The Central government has shut down all the monuments, museums and national parks. Private companies have urged employees to work from home and some state governments are considering a similar move.

The World Health Organisation has praised India's commitment to combat the novel coronavirus, with a special shoutout for PM Modi.

""I think the commitment of the Indian government from the top level -- the Prime Minister's office himself -- has been enormous, very impressive. This is one of the reasons why India is doing very well,"" said Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India.

At the meeting, the Prime Minister expressed gratitude to all those at the forefront of combating COVID-19, ""including the various State Governments, medical fraternity, paramedical staff, armed and paramilitary forces, those associated with aviation sector, municipal staff and others"", his office said in another tweet."

"South Korea's coronavirus lessons: Quick, easy tests; monitoring",['Kelly Kasulis'],"More than 8,800 people around the world have now died from COVID-19, and countries are turning to draconian measures from sealing borders to stay-at-home orders to try and curb its spread.

But in South Korea, once the country with the worst outbreak outside China, life seems to be going on with some sense of normalcy.

More:

Dozens line up at pharmacies to buy their government-rationed face masks every week and many are working from home, but businesses carry on and cities have yet to be subjected to a government-instituted lockdown.

Even better, South Korea has one of the lowest casualty rates from COVID-19 in the world, at just 1 percent.

""South Korea really distinguished itself for being able to transparently disclose information and combat the virus,"" said Hwang Seung-sik, an epidemiologist and professor at Seoul National University.

""We did our best to stockpile resources and we worked hard to mass-test people and conduct quarantines. But the coronavirus has been around for about three months now, and it's not very clear what preparations the US or other European countries have made.""

Swift action

South Korea's coronavirus outbreak is a lesson in early action and swift containment.

One month ago on February 18, South Korea diagnosed its 31st patient with COVID-19, and she soon became known as the country's ""super-spreader.""

A middle-aged woman who took part in mass congregations at a religious group called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Patient 31 passed the virus onto other members of the faithful as well as other unsuspecting residents of the southeastern city of Daegu.

Suddenly, South Korea's coronavirus cases multiplied 180-fold in a two-week span. At its peak, medical experts were diagnosing more than 900 new cases a day, making South Korea the second-largest outbreak in the world.

Blocking off certain areas and stopping movement was what people did in the Middle Ages when they were dealing with the Black Death. Dr Roh Kyoung-ho, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital

Now, that growth rate has significantly slowed - and there is even talk that the outbreak might have peaked.

""We indeed succeeded in decreasing the rate of new confirmed cases to less than 100 per day. It's a big accomplishment, but we can't celebrate that just yet,"" Hwang said. ""This could be an optical illusion that's fooling us into believing that the outbreak is over - an illusion caused by the previously skyrocketing numbers in Daegu.""

More than 8,500 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in South Korea as of mid-morning on March 19, and nearly three-quarters of those cases are concentrated in Daegu.

Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, the virus rages on: nearly 3,000 people have died in Italy, along with 1,135 in Iran and 638 in Spain, according to Johns Hopkins University which is tracking the pandemic. US casualties have already outpaced those in South Korea. In China, where the virus was first detected late last year, more than 3,200 have died.

Even so, medical experts caution about being over-confident.

""It's difficult to say that the Korean government has gained full control over coronavirus,"" said Roh Kyoung-ho, a doctor who works at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital. ""Since Korea is a country with a high population density, there is a big possibility that coronavirus can return with high propagation power and it may even appear as just a small group infection to start.""

Last week, South Korea saw a new cluster of cases around a call centre in Seoul, reversing an 11-day trend of declining infection rates.

On Thursday, a new cluster emerged at a nursing home in Daegu, ending four days of daily cases below 100.

""We shouldn't be so conceited about our results just yet,"" Hwang agreed.

Widespread testing

Nevertheless, South Korea's success in controlling the epidemic has garnered praise from around the world.

When Chinese scientists first published the COVID-19 virus' genetic sequence in January, at least four South Korean firms quietly began developing and stockpiling test kits alongside the government - well before the country had its first outbreak.

By the time things got bad, the country had the ability to test more than 10,000 people per day, including at makeshift drive-through testing centres and newly added consultation phone booths at hospitals.

Anyone with a mobile phone in the country also received alerts about nearby infection paths so that citizens could avoid areas where the virus was known to be active.

At the same time, the South Korean government created a GPS-enabled app to monitor those under quarantine and set off an alarm if they ventured outdoors. Travellers entering the country are also being asked to record their symptoms on a state-sponsored app.

Unlike other countries, South Korea also managed to turn its outbreak around without locking down cities or banning travel. In fact, the term ""social distancing"" first originated with the South Korean president's campaign against the virus.

However, that does not mean all other countries should follow suit. South Korea's mass-testing and early detection may have afforded it the luxury of being able to avoid declaring a total shutdown.

""Because Korea has the ability to sample and test faster than in other countries, there was no reason to do what other countries are doing [and lock down],"" Roh said.

""The method of blocking off certain areas and stopping movement was what people did in the Middle Ages when they were dealing with the Black Death. It was because they didn't know what was causing infections at the time and they didn't know where the disease was spreading.""

At least 15 South Korean firms are racing to develop vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19. Some are attempting to develop a testing kit for people to use at home, while others are already in the middle of clinical trials.

Hwang estimates it will not be until around the second half of 2021 that a vaccine will become available to the public.

Until then some of the old methods of containment, supported by 21st-century technologies, may still prove most effective.

""We have to keep focusing on our fight against this crisis until then,"" he said.

Doctor's Note: Coronavirus and your mental health,"['Dr Amir Khan', 'About The Author', 'Dr Amir Khan Is An Nhs Doctor', 'A Senior University Lecturer In The United Kingdom.']","The world is a stressful place right now. The coronavirus pandemic has got people panic-buying, desperately scrolling social media platforms for the latest information and worrying about conspiracy theories. It is a lot to take in.

Around 264 million people around the world suffer from an anxiety disorder, with it being more common in women than in men. The World Health Organization (WHO) also lists obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in its top 10 most disabling conditions as measured by lost income and decreased quality of life.

More Doctor's Notes:

My clinics are filling up with patients whose mental health has been affected by this constant bombardment of information about coronavirus and worse, uncertainty.

They are understandably worried about some of the things they are hearing. Some of the rumours and bogus ""advice"" I have heard include drinking water every 15 minutes to avoid contracting the virus and the idea that taking a deep breath will help you decide if the virus has damaged your lungs.

To be absolutely clear - neither of these is true.

People who have had no prior history of mental health issues are suddenly having trouble sleeping, concentrating and getting on with their normal day-to-day lives. Those with a prior history of anxiety or OCD have found their symptoms have been exacerbated by the news of COVID-19.

Is the general public right to be anxious about the increasingly alarming news regarding the spread of COVID-19? The answer, as with many things, is yes, but in moderation.

Now, more than ever, we need to keep our mental health in as good a condition as possible.

One problem is the rate at which news about coronavirus is coming out and how quickly the information is changing.

But worse is the amount of ""fake news"" out there and how difficult it is to find reliable sources of information. It is human to feel the need to be on top of the latest guidance; nobody wants to risk contracting the disease.

The uncertainty and feeling of a lack of control are what underpins most people's anxiety. You are waiting for something to happen, and that in itself feeds further anxiety.

Another problem is that the new protocols around washing hands and not touching our faces, among other things, may well be making some people with OCD more unwell.

People with OCD often already exhibit repetitive cleaning behaviours, such as cleaning door handles, kitchens and bathrooms over and over. This may not sound too bad, but when it stops them from doing anything else, it becomes a significant problem in their lives.

If these people are now being told that they must wash their hands in a certain way every two hours, or clean surfaces regularly, it may cause their symptoms to spiral and they, too, then feel they have lost control.

So what steps can we take to reduce the chance of COVID-19 having a detrimental effect on our mental health?

Limit your news intake

We all want to be up to date, but you need downtime - especially from what is going on out there right now.

Limit the time you spend on social media and news outlets. This will give you some mental space for other things. But be strict with yourself; it will not be easy. Mute keywords on social media if you need to.

Do some exercise

Exercise has long been shown to have a beneficial effect on mental health, and it is no different now.

Even if you are confined to your home, you can still take a stroll around the garden, up and down your stairs or even do ""chairobics"" - exercises for less mobile people that can be done while sitting in a chair - to your favourite music.

Get some fresh air

Being outdoors has lots of health benefits, but increasingly it is being used to help manage anxiety and mood disorders.

If they are still accessible, woodlands and open parks are among the few places where chances of catching the coronavirus are low, so, if you can, find a time when it is likely to be less crowded and go for a walk. And try not to look at your phone.

Ration your worry time

If you find yourself falling into repetitive habits because you are fretting about coronavirus, limit the number of times you can wash your hands or clean surfaces. Limit your ""worry time"" over COVID-19 to a particular hour of each day and then try not to think about it for the rest of the day.

Above all, keep reminding yourself that most people who get COVID-19 will have only mild symptoms and will make a full recovery."
What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?,[],"A deadly new coronavirus that emerged in China in late December has spread to more than 160 countries on six continents, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the pathogen a global pandemic.

On March 18, the death toll from the virus reached 7,873 and the number of reported cases surged to more than 194,000 globally.

The majority of cases were reported in mainland China, but the rapid advance of the infection - known as COVID-19 - has triggered worries across the globe.

More:

As fear spread, scientists and researchers around the world ramped up efforts to understand the new virus and how it affects the human body.

Here is what we know about COVID-19 and what happens if you are infected.

'Varying levels of severity'

The new virus belongs to a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses in humans ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

200205205234883

Thought to have been transmitted to humans from an as-yet-unidentified animal source, the new virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, such as those generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

On average, it takes about five to six days for someone to show symptoms after becoming infected. However, some people who carry the virus remain asymptomatic, meaning they do not show any symptoms.

The virus multiplies in the respiratory tract and can cause a range of symptoms, according to Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme.

""You have mild cases, which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms, sore throat, runny nose, fever, all the way through pneumonia. And there can be varying levels of severity of pneumonia all the way through multi-organ failure and death,"" she told reporters in Geneva on February 7.

However, in most cases, symptoms have remained mild.

""We've seen some data on about 17,000 cases and, overall, 82 percent of those are mild, 15 percent of those are severe and 3 percent of those are classified as critical,"" said Van Kerkhove.

Fever, cough, pneumonia

A study of 138 patients infected with the new virus in Wuhan, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on February 7, showed the most common symptoms were fever, fatigue and dry cough. A third of the patients also reported muscle pain and difficulty breathing, while about 10 percent had atypical symptoms, including diarrhoea and nausea.

The patients, who ranged in age from 22 to 92, were admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 1 and 28. ""The median age of patients is between 49 and 56 years,"" JAMA said. ""Cases in children have been rare.""

While most cases appeared to be mild, all the patients developed pneumonia, according to JAMA.

About a third subsequently developed severe breathing difficulties, requiring treatment in the intensive care unit. The critically ill were older and had other underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.

Six of the 138 patients died - a figure amounting to a 4.3-percent death rate, which is higher than estimates from other parts of China. Less than 2 percent of the total number of infected people have died from the virus so far but that figure could change.

Meanwhile, a study published on January 24 in The Lancet medical journal found what it called a ""cytokine storm"" in infected patients who were severely ill. A cytokine storm is a severe immune reaction in which the body produces immune cells and proteins that can destroy other organs.

Some experts say this could explain deaths in younger patients. Statistics from China show some people in their 30s, 40s and 50s, who were not known to have had prior medical issues, have also died from the disease.

A timeline of how the disease progresses

According to JAMA, on average, people became short of breath within five days of the onset of their symptoms. Severe breathing trouble was observed in about eight days.

The study did not give a timeline for when the deaths occurred.

However, an earlier study published in the Journal of Medical Virology on January 29 said that, on average, people who died did so within 14 days of the onset of the disease.

The New England Journal of Medicine, in a study published on January 31, also offered a look at how the coronavirus infection affects the body over time.

The study examined the medical data of a 35-year-old man, the first case of infection in the United States. The first symptom was a dry cough, followed by a fever.

On the third day of illness, he reported nausea and vomiting followed by diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort on the sixth day. By the ninth day, he had developed pneumonia and reported difficulty breathing.

By the twelfth day, his condition had improved and his fever was subsiding. He developed a runny nose, however. On day 14, he was asymptomatic except for a mild cough.

According to local media reports, he sought care on January 19 and was discharged from the hospital in the first week of February.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO chief, told reporters on February 24 that statistics from China suggest recovery time for people with mild disease is about two weeks. People with severe or critical disease may take between three and six weeks to recover.

On February 28, Ghebreyesus said nations should prepare themselves for a potential pandemic, as countries aside from China now accout for three-quarters of new infections.

On March 4, Ghebreyesus warned that a global shortage and price gouging for protective equipment was compromising countries' abilities to respond to the epidemic, and called on companies and governments to increase production by 40 percent.

On March 11, the WHO chief characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic and expressed concern over the ""alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction""."
"Coronavirus: Travel restrictions, border shutdowns by country",[],"Countries around the world are increasingly adopting sweeping measures to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, including shutting down airports, imposing travel restrictions and completely sealing their borders.

Coronavirus emergency kit: Social distancing to flatten the curve,[],"Countries around the world are closing borders and putting citizens under lockdown in a bid to contain the new coronavirus outbreak, labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO's declaration has increased pressure on governments to ramp up their response, sparking emergency action plans and upending life around the globe.

More:

Here's what you need to know about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19:

How to protect yourself

Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap; cover your face with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing, and then throw the tissue in a waste bin; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; clean surfaces and objects you touch often; seek medical attention if you have symptoms; and avoid direct contact with live animals in affected areas.

Scientists doubt the effectiveness of face masks in protecting a healthy person from airborne viruses, saying they are more useful in keeping an infected person from affecting others.

Because masks are loose and permeable, they cannot completely prevent what is in the air from passing in.

An increasing number of countries has advised people to self-quarantine for at least two weeks while also implementing a series of sweeping social distancing measures, including banning public gatherings and shutting down schools.

But as the number of cases grows, so do the myths surrounding the new coronavirus. Here and here, we clear up some of the rumours and misconceptions around the outbreak.

Social distancing to 'flatten the curve'

It is essential to maintain social distancing - including staying at least 1.8 metres (six feet) away from anyone around you.

The aim of social distancing is to slow the spread of the virus, giving global health systems more time to care for patients who need help, which is also known as ""flattening the curve"".

Social distancing is most effective when the infection can be transmitted via droplet contact (coughing or sneezing), which is the case with the coronavirus.

Cancellations of public events that draw large crowds, such as sports events or music festivals, are an essential part of social distancing, but avoiding smaller gatherings is equally important, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Social distancing techniques that allow you to avoid crowds or crowded spaces are working from home instead of at the office, closing schools or switching to online classes, and visiting loved ones via electronic devices instead of in person.

Symptoms to look for and who is most at risk

According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and a dry cough. Some patients may experience aches and pains, nasal congestion, a runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea.

Current estimates of the incubation period - the amount of time between infection and the onset of symptoms - range from one to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to six days.

However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, not displaying symptoms despite having the virus in their system.

The elderly and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

Can hot weather stop coronavirus?

A dramatic surge in coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia in recent days has increased doubts over a theory that warmer weather could stem the spread of the virus, health experts say.

Relatively low numbers of new infections in many Southeast Asian countries had been cited as possible evidence that hotter weather was suppressing the virus, giving hope to Europe and the United States as they head into spring.

But countries from Indonesia to Thailand to Malaysia and the Philippines have recorded their highest rate of infections in recent days as testing has ramped up, in a sign seasonal factors may only play a limited role in coronavirus' spread.

""The temperature theory doesn't really hold up given what's happening right now in much of Southeast Asia,"" said Tikki Pangestu, a professor at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. ""People in Europe hope warm weather will kill the virus. I doubt this will be the reality.""

The spike in cases in many Southeast Asian countries has been dramatic in recent days, leading governments to take drastic action to stem the tide.

""At best, warm weather might influence the spread but it will not see the end of it,"" said Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organization.

""What is important is how effectively countries are isolating cases, removing people from communities. That's the biggest factor, not the weather.""

What to do if you think you caught the virus

A dedicated hotline has been set up in several countries for people who suspect they have been infected.

People in the country are asked to contact the hotline before going to a hospital, to avoid the possibility of spreading the virus in an unprepared healthcare facility or on the way there.

Individuals are required to contact specialised help as soon as they suspect they are ill, and to limit contact with others as much as possible.

To date, there is no vaccine and no medicine for COVID-19. While some traditional or home remedies can provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of the disease, there is no proof that existing medicine can prevent or cure it, according to the WHO.

How to prepare for self-quarantine or lockdown

At least 14 days are recommended for a self-quarantine, while the duration of a lockdown depends on the decision of a local government.

Given the likelihood that more and more people around the world will be house-bound, preparing one's home for that eventuality is an increasing concern.

Among the things being stocked are:

Non-perishable foods, including shelf-stable beverages, sauces, pasta, pulses, rice, cereal, crackers, and dry goods, including tea, sugar, and coffee.

Basic medical supplies, including over-the-counter medications to alleviate possible symptoms - which, in mild cases, have a lot in common with the symptoms of the common cold. Medicines for fever, congestion, and cough are recommended. It is also important to keep a one-month supply of prescription medication on hand as well in case getting to a pharmacy for a refill becomes difficult.

Cleaning and hygiene supplies needed would include soaps for handwashing, bathing, laundry, and cleaning, as well as disinfectants to keep surfaces clean.

Also important is preparing some activities that can be undertaken within the home, whether a list of books to read or an entertainment or exercise subscription that can be used without going out.

The WHO has acknowledged the crisis is causing the public increased levels of anxiety.

In recently published guidance, it advises people who are feeling stressed to avoid reading, watching and listening to news excessively.

Avoid anti-inflammatory drugs

France's Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Twitter on Saturday for pain relief it was better to take paracetamol because over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen the coronavirus.

""The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor's advice,"" said Veran.

Patients should choose paracetamol, also known known in the United States by the generic name acetaminophen and commonly by the brand name Tylenol, because ""it will reduce the fever without counter-attacking the inflammation"", the health ministry added.

Anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body's immune system.

Germany warns against 'coronavirus parties'

A senior German government medical adviser has urged people to refrain from holding ""corona parties"" amid a shutdown of bars and clubs to curb the spread of the virus.

Lars Schaade of the Robert Koch Institute, the German government's disease control institute, said Monday that as measures are taken to encourage social distancing ""it's not sensible, instead of going to a club, to invite people to big parties at home.""

""I say this because there are apparently already so-called corona parties when the clubs are closed,"" he told reporters in Berlin. ""Please don't do that.""

There have been more than 4,800 cases of infections with the new coronavirus in Germany, and 12 deaths so far.

Myths and misinformation

There is a lot of information being shared widely regarding how people can avoid catching the virus. Below are some of the myths floating around that are not supported by scientific evidence that people should not panic over:

Mosquitoes bites

Do not panic if you live in a mosquito-infested region. According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence or information showing COVID-19 could be transmitted by mosquitoes.

Spraying alcohol or chlorine

Alcohol and chlorine can be used to disinfect surfaces. Do not panic if you have neither. Once the virus has entered your body, spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill it. In fact, spraying alcohol or chlorine can be harmful.

Snow and cold weather

There is no evidence showing that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus. COVID-19 can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather.

Eating Garlic

Keep calm if you do not like eating garlic. Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. But, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus, according to WHO.

Drinking water

There is no scientific evidence that supports consuming large volumes of water can help individuals flush out the virus.

Taking antibiotics

Antibiotics work only on bacteria. They do not work against viruses. The coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus."
Rising number of medical staff infected with coronavirus in Italy,['Elisa Oddone'],"Rome, Italy - As coronavirus cases jump and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel.

At least 2,629 health workers have been infected by coronavirus since the onset of the outbreak in February, representing 8.3 percent of total cases, according to a report published on Wednesday by Gruppo Italiano per la Medicina Basata sulle Evidenze or GIMBE - Italy's Group for Evidence-based Medicine.

More:

The data has sent shock waves through the country's already strained healthcare system.

""We extracted this number from data provided by the National Health Institute,"" GIMBE director Nino Cartabellotta, a public health expert, told Al Jazeera.

""Figures regarding the contagion among doctors, nurses and general health professionals have started being disclosed only on March 11. Hundreds of new cases have been daily recorded since then. But medical personnel on the front line should be the first to be protected.""

Cartabellotta said that the actual number was likely to be higher because healthcare workers are not always tested and protection measures at hospitals were inadequate.

Many who tend to coronavirus patients are still only using surgical face masks with no proper protective filters to shield them from contagion.

The percentage of health workers infected in Italy is almost double the number registered throughout the epidemic in China, where more than 3,200 have died.

According to figures published in JAMA Network Open, an online medical site from the Journal of the American Medical Association, infected medical staff in China made up 3.8 percent of the total cases, with only five deaths.

Over 60 percent of the medical staff who were infected were registered in the epicentre's outbreak, Wuhan.

Italy is the worst-hit country after China.

On Wednesday, Italy announced that over the past 24 hours, the number of deaths had risen by 475 to 2,978, an increase of 19 percent, as cases jumped to a total 35,713.

There are no official figures on the number of medical personnel who have died of coronavirus in Italy.

According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, a general practitioner from the province of Lodi died on Wednesday. This raised the death toll of family doctors in the area to four. Other regions have also registered losses among medical staff.

A lack of equipment, resources and personnel has piled pressure on Italy's health system.

Italy does not produce masks. With the pandemic spreading, some of its closest neighbours have been reluctant to export supplies they may need soon.

""The problem right now is the supply of the protective gear,"" Cartabellotta said. ""The government should have thought of this some time ago. It is logical that following the global explosion of the pandemic, countries producing masks and other protective devices are now keeping them to themselves and stopped their exports.

""We already have a limited number of doctors and nurses. Under extreme circumstances, we could even ask them to keep working even if [they] tested positive for coronavirus. Still, they should be equipped with protective devices to avoid spreading the virus further.""

An emergency decree presented by the government on Monday allocated 3.5 billion euros ($3.8bn) towards the ailing health system.

""We are importing medical personnel from abroad and throwing new young healthcare professionals without licenses into the fray,"" Cartabellotta said. ""If we don't provide them with adequate protection, it will end up like in a war where soldiers don't die while fighting on the battlefield, but because of lack of equipment. The more medical personnel is infected, the weaker the responsiveness of the healthcare system."""
"Iran's Khamenei to pardon 10,000 prisoners ahead of Nowruz",[],"Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will pardon 10,000 prisoners including political detainees to mark the Iranian new year on Friday, according to state television.

""Those who will be pardoned will not return to jail ... almost half of those security-related prisoners will be pardoned as well,"" judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told state TV on Wednesday.

More:

On Tuesday, Esmaili said Iran had temporarily freed about 85,000 people from jail, including political prisoners, in response to the coronavirus epidemic.

""A large number of prisoners who have been temporarily freed do not need to return to jail after the leader's pardon,"" Esmaili said.

""The unprecedented point is that the pardon also includes the security-related prisoners with less than five-year jail sentences,"" Esmaili said.

Esmaili did not say whether it would include British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was allowed temporary release on Tuesday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed for five years in 2016.

Iran said it had 189,500 people in prison, according to a report that the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Javaid Rehman, submitted to the Human Rights Council in January.

They are believed to include hundreds arrested during or after anti-government protests in November.

The coronavirus outbreak has prompted calls from the United Nations and the United States for political prisoners, including dozens of dual nationals and foreigners, to be released from Iran's overcrowded jails.

Washington has warned Iran that it would hold the Tehran government directly responsible for the deaths of any jailed Americans.

Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners over recent years, including citizens of the US, Britain, Canada, Australia, Austria, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Lebanon.

Tehran denies it holds people on political ground and has mainly accused foreign prisoners of espionage.

In June 2019, Iran released Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese businessman with US permanent residency, after four years in prison. Last year, Iran also released Xiyue Wang, a US citizen who had been held for three years on spying charges.

Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting a number of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries - a charge the Islamic Republic has regularly dismissed.

Tehran has called for the release of about several dozen Iranians held in US prisons, mostly for violating sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear programme.

Frictions have risen between longtime foes Iran and the US since 2018 when Washington quit Iran’s nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy.

Tehran has since gradually scaled back its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal, under which most sanctions on the country were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing its sensitive nuclear work."

"Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi takes oath as RS member, Opposition MPs shout 'shame' slogans, stage walkout",[],"New Delhi: Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday (March 19, 2020) took oath as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha amidst unprecedented scenes of opposition members shouting slogans and walking out of the House.

This is the first time ever that the House has witnessed slogan shouting and walkout during oath-taking.

Gogoi, 65, who retired as the Chief Justice of India in November last year after a tenure of 13 months, took oath in English in the name of God. As his name was called for oath-taking, Congress and Left members started shouting slogans like 'Shame on You' and 'Deal'.

Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu ordered that the slogan shouting will not go on record. As Gogoi took the oath, Congress, Left and their allies shouted slogans and staged a walkout from the House.

Naidu said it was not fair to shout slogans. ""It is very unbecoming of members of Parliament."" ""No, this is not the way. Nothing will go on record. (It is) very unfair, very unfair,"" Naidu said as Gogoi completed his oath.

After taking the oath, Gogoi walked up to the chair to greet Naidu, who responded to his greetings with folded hands.

Naidu said members have the liberty to express their views outside the House on the issue. ""You know the Constitutional provision, you know the precedent, you know the power of the President (to nominate a member to Rajya Sabha),"" he said.

""You should not do anything in the House. Whatever views you have you are at liberty to express outside,"" he said.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who was among the first to greet Gogoi when he entered the House minutes before the proceedings began, said what opposition members did was ""grossly unfair"".

""This House has a great tradition of having many eminent persons coming from diverse fields including former justices nominated by those who have shouted today,"" Prasad said.

""Hon'ble member Gogoi, who has taken oath today, will surely contribute his best as a nominated member. And it was grossly unfair to do like this,"" he said.

Naidu said, ""We must respect a member."" Gogoi was nominated to Rajya Sabha by President Ram Nath Kovind.

He was nominated in the vacancy created after the retirement of KTS Tulsi.

Earlier, Gogoi entered the House from the Chariman's chamber and greeted members present with folded hands. Prasad greeted him with a loud ""welcome Gogoi dada"". Shortly thereafter he was escorted to his designated seat in the second last row where he sat quietly alongside Sonal Mansingh, another nominated member of the House.

During Gogoi's 13-month tenure, the Supreme Court delivered landmark judgements in the Ayodhya case, on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the entry of women in Kerala's Sabarimala temple and the Rafale jet deal along with Assam's National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The Congress has argued that Gogoi's nomination to Rajya Sabha ""within four months"" of his retirement will shake the confidence and faith people have in the independence of the judiciary.

The party has also tried to distinguish between Gogoi's nomination and that of some of his predecessors' entry into the Rajya Sabha ""six to seven years"" after their retirement."

We do know that these 16 (MLAs) tilt the balance in one way or the other... If they choose to come, they should have free, unhindered and uninterrupted access to the assembly,"" the court said.

It was hearing the petitions filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking the trust vote in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP had claimed in its petition that after the resignation of 22 MLAs, the Kamal Nath government has come in minority and demanded a floor test to prove their majority while the Congress argued that its MLAs were held captive in Bengaluru.

Earlier, the Madhya Pradesh Congress had told the apex court that a probe is needed on the resignation letters of its rebel MLAs submitted by BJP leaders to the Speaker of the state Assembly.

Meanwhile, veteran Congress leader Digvijay Singh who is in Bengaluru to meet with the dissenting MLAs was denied permission by the local police and in protest he sat on dharna outside the resort where the legislators have been put up. Singh and other Congress leaders like Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar, Madhya Pradesh Congress leaders Sajjan Singh Verma and Kantilal Bhuria were taken into preventive custody.

The Kamal Nath-led government plunged into crisis after Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the Congress, after which 22 MLAs loyal to him resigned in Madhya Pradesh last week. The BJP sensing an opportunity, demanded a floor test in the assembly.

The Speaker has accepted the resignations of six of the 22 MLAs, bringing down the effective strength of the House to 222 and the new majority mark at 112. The opposition BJP has 107 MLAs.

After the MP assembly was adjourned on Monday till March 26, the BJP petitioned the Supreme Court seeking a direction from it for an early floor test."
Bollywood news: Salman Khan reveals why he loves staying in an apartment over a bungalow,[],"Mumbai: Supserstar Salman Khan has been living in a flat in Bandra's Galaxy Apartments for years now. He could have easily bought a bungalow for himself but he preferred staying there as his parents and family, and is deeply attached to the place.

""I love staying at my flat in Bandra over a big, luxurious bungalow because my parents live in the flat above mine. Ever since I was a child I have taken the same left turn or right turn and I would not have it any other way,"" Salman had earlier said.

The ""Dabangg"" actor had also shared his memories attached to his house.

""The entire building is like one big family. When we were little, all the kids of the building would play together in the garden below and sometimes even sleep there. Back then, there weren't different houses, all the houses were treated as our own and we would go into anyone's house to eat food. I still stay in the same flat because I have countless memories attached to that house,"" he had added.

In one of the old interviews, Salman's father, who is also a legendary screenwriter, had shared his love for his flat and why he wants to live there forever.

""I am very much attached to this place. If I ever leave this house, my heart will cry. Then I won't be able to live happily,"" Salim had said."

"Nirbhaya case: SC dismisses convict Pawan Gupta's curative plea, rejects his juvenility claim",[],"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday (March 19, 2020) dismissed death row convict Pawan Gupta's curative plea and rejected his juvenility claim in connection with the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

The top court passed the order while hearing the curative petition of Gupta, one of the convicts in 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case. In his plea, Gupta had claimed that he was a minor “at the time of the offence'' and thereby his death sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment”.

The matter will be taken up by the six-judge bench of the apex court.

On Wednesday, the Delhi High Court had dismissed an application filed by another convict Mukesh Singh, challenging the trial court order that had dismissed his plea, seeking a stay on the execution claiming he was not present in Delhi on December 16, 2012, the night of the crime.

A single-judge HC Bench, headed by Justice Brijesh Sethi, while dismissing the plea filed through advocate ML Sharma had observed, “There are no grounds to interfere in the in the detailed and reasoned order dated 17.03.2020, passed by the trial court.”

“There is nothing on record to suggest that trial stands vitiated because material evidence was concealed. There is, thus, no infirmity, illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the trial court,” the court had said.

Meanwhile, in what could be another ploy to delay hanging, wife of a Nirbhaya convict has filed for a divorce in a local court in Bihar’s Aurangabad. In the plea, the wife of convict Akshay Kumar Singh said she does not want to live the life of a widow as her husband is set to be hanged on March 20. The court has posted the matter for March 19.

Notably, the convicts are scheduled to be hanged on March 20, 5:30 AM."
"ICSE board postpones Class 10, 12 exams till March 31 due to coronavirus threat",[],"NEW DELHI: The ICSE Board on Thursday (March 19, 2020) postponed Class 10 and 12 examinations due to the novel coronavirus threat. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) Chief Executive Gerry Arathoon was quoted by PTI as saying that the exams have been postponed till March 31.

On Wednesday, Arathoon had said the exams will be conducted as per the schedule after the CBSE announced it has postponed exams till March 31.

This came after the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on Wednesday directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and all educational institutions in the country to postpone all exams including JEE Mains till March 31 in view of coronavirus outbreak.

""While the maintenance of academic calendar and exam schedule is important, equally important is safety and security of students, who are appearing in various examinations as also of their teachers and parents,"" HRD Secretary Amit Khare said in official communication.

""All ongoing examinations may be rescheduled after March 31. This would include CBSE, NIOS as also university exams. All evaluation work may be rescheduled after March 31,"" he said.

Stressing on JEE Main, the HRD Secretary said,. ""Since JEE Main may require travel by examinees to different towns and the dates may clash with rescheduled CBSE and other Board exams, therefore, JEE Main should be rescheduled and the new date of JEE Main will be announced on March 31 after re-assessment of situation.""

The HRD Ministry had requested all teachers and educational institutes to maintain regular communication with students and resolve their queries.

It has also appealed to parents, students, and teachers not to panic. A total of 169 positive cases of coronavirus have been reported in India so far, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said on Wednesday. Three people have so far died of the infection in the country.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The virus had first emerged in China`s Wuhan city in December last year."
"Coronavirus: Bureaucrat mother, father of Kolkata’s Covid-19 patient test negative",[],"In a major sigh of relief for West Bengal secretariat- Nabanna, the West Bengal Health Department informed that the bureaucrat mother, father and the two drivers who ferried the Covid-19 patient in Kolkata have tested negative.

The Health Department informed that four swab samples of mother, father and the two drivers who ferried the Covid-19 patient were sent to NICED and all have tested negative.

However, all four have been shifted to Kolkata’s quarantine facility in Rajarhat and have to remain there for the next 14 days.

The Covid-19 patient identified as a 18 year-old-boy from Kolkata, is a student of Oxford University who had returned to Kolkata on March 15 from UK but did not show any symptoms of Coronavirus.

However, despite repeated requests from the state health department to go into compulsory quarantine according to the government advisory as he has a travel history he refused to do so.

The incident sent shock waves in the city of Kolkata after facts appeared that the Covid-19 patient had even visited his mother’s office at the Bengal state secretariat - Nabanna and Writers Buildings. The bureaucrat mother is a special secretary of Home Department at the Government of West Bengal.

The bureaucrat mother was seen attending office till March 16, participating in meetings and even coming in contact with other officials in the government.

Meanwhile, the Home Secretary in the West Bengal Government, Alapan Bandyapadhyay and his wife has been sent to home quarantine as he came in contact with the mother of the Covid-19 patient.

According to sources, the Covid-19 patient had visited shopping malls, night clubs and several other places before being admitted to Beleghata ID&BG hospital on March 17 and testing positive for Coronavirus.

Furious at the irresponsible behaviour of the bureaucrat and her son, the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee came heavily on them and said, “We are not going to tolerate any VIP culture as far as Coronavirus is concerned. Rules for all are same whether you are a VIP or LIP - lesser important person. You cannot use influence to get away with tests and put others life at risk.”"
Sex in the time of coronavirus: A fictitious couple's real problems,[],"""You know, your celibacy thing doesn't seem like a bad idea.""

It was inevitable: the scent of Dettol handrub always reminded him of the balmy spring evening the twins were conceived. ""The coronials,"" his wife liked to call them. She had recently taken to cooing that unfortunate word at Sara and Tanisha with wide-eyed delight every chance she got. The girls, bless them, never failed to return cold stares -- a sign of excellent taste in diction, he thought. But he had only himself to blame: he should have never WhatsApp-ed Nisha those darned tweets predicting a baby boom after the coronavirus.

""Gen-C.""

""Quarant-ennials.""

""Covidians.""

Coronials - name given to babies born in 9 months time Pandora Sykes (@PINsykes) March 18, 2020

He still winced when he remembered what her response had been: to send him a news article excerpt -- a ""medical ethicist's"" views on proper conduct during the coronavirus pandemic.

Q: ""Is it OK to have sex with my partner?""

A: ""No. I would say unless you've just been tested and waited five days that you shouldn't. No kissing either.""

His alarm must have been palpable: he caught his boss, a one-time environment reporter, looking at him with the kind of concern he normally only reserved for the slender-billed vulture and the Wayanad mahseer.

His phone buzzed -- it was Nisha again:

""#SixMonthsOfCelibacy.""

He blinked.

The prime minister's words came to mind. No to panic, yes to precautions.

Easier said than done, he mumbled, as he quickly filled six Chrome tabs: ""Coronavirus and sex. Coronavirus sex precautions. Covid-19 sex precautions. Coronavirus safe to have sex? Coronavirus spreads through sex?""

And, with the keenest access of desperation he had ever felt: ""Go corona. Corona go.""

The hours flew by. When the boss walked into his cubicle -- ""Hey, where are we on the Jim Corbett feature?"" -- he was deep in contemplation, studying a meme suggesting a safer alternative to the missionary position (the artist's suggestion being: all the better to avoid coughing into your partner's face).

He heard the sound of hastily retreating footsteps before he could answer.

Later, on the cab ride home, he reviewed his findings. There was very little on offer to pierce his gloom.

The coronavirus wasn't sexually transmitted but contaminated respiratory droplets and hands were still a risk -- sex, after all, was the spectacular opposite of social distancing.

People with symptoms shouldn't do it -- um, duh.

And those who didn't have them?

He shuddered as he remembered one expert's words: ""I guess I could imagine everybody showering, sanitising yourself when you came into the house, and showering beforehand and making sure you're never face-to-face, but it doesn't sound like a lot of fun.""

Duh.

Another's were far more encouraging -- ""a really great way to have fun, stay connected and relieve anxiety during this potentially stressful time"" -- but failed to lift him. There were so many ifs.

Regular partner? Sure.

No symptoms? Check. But what about asymptomatic transmission?

No recent likely exposure? Testing was limited -- how could anyone really know?

He looked out. Mask-clad pedestrians flew in and out of view. He turned to his phone and flicked his news feed up and down. ""Sex Workers Face Ruin Amid Virus Fears, Brothel Closures."" ""Porn Industry Calls For Shutdown Due To Coronavirus.""

He imagined another dire headline: ""Coronavirus: Delhi Couple Starts Trend With #SixMonthsOfCelibacy.""

At home, she found Nisha on the sofa with a book in her hand -- she still had her respirator on. She beheld him with a raised eyebrow. ""Covidians? Really?""

""Six months, really?""

They exchanged glances. Nisha stifled a chuckle.

""Relax,"" she said. ""I began working from home before this corona stuff made it a thing. And the last time you touched your face was two months ago. Speaking of which, please shave.""

He sat down next to her. She laid her head on his shoulder.

They sat quietly for a while.

""You know, your celibacy thing doesn't seem like a bad idea.""

Nisha snorted into his shirt.

""I'm serious,"" he said, surprised by the reproach in his tone. He reached for the half-empty bottle of handrub on the coffee table, ignoring the peals of laughter.

""I mean, how can anyone really know they're not a risk?"" He poured a dollop on his palm and looked at Nisha. ""Hands.""

She obliged. Her blush of amusement hadn't drained.

""And how long do you think you could keep that up?"" she asked.

She scooped up a drop from her wet palm and, drawing closer, touched the tip of his nose.

""I mean, the no-sex stuff?""

He looked at her and realised she no longer had the mask on.

He smiled.

Taking her hand in his, he whispered, ""If you can bear to wait, then forever.""

Rajya Sabha election: Where extra player changes rules of game,[],"Against 55 vacancies in the Rajya Sabha, 37 have been elected unopposed but intense fight is on for remaining 18 seats across seven states. (Photo: PTI)

The election to the Rajya Sabha is indirect. The directly elected MLAs in the state assembly send their -- and thereby the people's -- representatives to the Rajya Sabha. Since the number of MLAs are fixed in the state assemblies and secured by the anti-defection law, the Rajya Sabha elections have rather been a boring exercise for political observers, except for the issue of who gets the party tickets.

This is why most of the time, Rajya Sabha elections have seen candidates getting elected unopposed to the upper house of Parliament. The parties certainly winning the Rajya Sabha seat on account of number of MLAs would put up exactly the same number of candidates.

In sum total, the final number of candidates of all parties equalled the total number of vacancies from the state. There was no race for snatching another’s seat in a Rajya Sabha election. No one would field extra candidates and hope a defection from the other camp.

A total of 37 candidates were elected to the Rajya Sabha in the same old manner this year, too.

But this seems to be changing in recent times, often witnessing top leaderships of respective parties involve not only in candidate selection, but also in ensuring that the candidates get the votes on the day of election.

The Rajya Sabha election of 2017 in Gujarat was a typical case of changing nature of the polls for the Upper House. There were three seats on offer and it was an easy calculation that the BJP would get two and the Congress one, on the basis of their respective strength in Gujarat Assembly. Only three candidates were in the fray.

But just ahead of the polls, the Congress saw half-a-dozen MLAs resign, casting a doubt on whether the party's high-profile candidate Ahmed Patel would win or not. He needed 44 votes and the Congress had 51 MLAs, plus the support of one NCP legislator. In the end, Patel got exactly 44, as at least one more Congress MLA voted against him. It was all blamed on the BJP, whose Amit Shah and Smriti Irani comfortably made it to the Rajya Sabha.

This time around, the trend of the Rajya Sabha election turning into a political battleground is more pronounced. Though 37 have been elected unopposed against the vacancy of 55 seats, extra players have been pushed into the game this year. These extra players have made the Rajya Sabha election a tight contest in some states, including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Jharkhand.

In Madhya Pradesh, three seats are up for grabs. Going by original strength, the ruling Congress should get two and the BJP one. But then Jyotiraditya Scindia hit the Congress in Madhya Pradesh.

Along with 22 MLAs, Scindia resigned from the Congress. The BJP fielded him in the Rajya Sabha election and named Sumer Singh Solanki as extra player in the game who also threatens the Kamal Nath government in the state. The Congress named its master political dribbler Digvijaya Singh and also Phool Singh Baraiya as extra player to match the BJP at its own game.

In Gujarat, five Congress MLAs resigned to make a contest out of a straightforward number equation. Gujarat has to elect four Rajya Sabha MPs -- two each for the BJP and the Congress were expected. The resignations have made the Congress gasp for breath.

While the Congress's players were catching their breath, the BJP introduced an old Congress hand, Narhari Amin, as the extra player in the Rajya Sabha contest in Gujarat. It had already fielded Abhay Bharadwaj and Ramila Bara in the Rajya Sabha election. In the catch up game, the Congress fielded two of its senior leaders, Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki.

The spillover effect was seen in Rajasthan as well, where the Congress was set to win two Rajya Sabha seats. It fielded Congress general secretary KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi of the Youth Congress. The BJP was expected to win the third seat on offer -- for which it had fielded Rajendra Gehlot. But the party named Onkar Singh Lakhawat as the extra player, creating a buzz and giving a few sleepless nights to Venugopal, a close aide of the Gandhis of the Congress.

What the BJP has done in these three states, the Congress is trying in Jharkhand, where Rajya Sabha election is being held for two seats. In the Jharkhand Assembly, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the BJP should be winning one seat apiece easily.

But the Congress, which is part of the ruling alliance led by the JMM, named Shahzada Anwar as an extra player in the contest in its bid to make the election of BJP state president Deepak Prakash difficult, as JMM patron Shibu Soren is expected to easily win the polls.

A contest is also on in Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya. In Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress Party of Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has an overwhelming majority and is likely to win all four seats. Considering this, the TDP of N Chandrababu Naidu had initially decided not to contest the election, but fielded a candidate at the last minute. It is more a reflection of rivalry between Reddy and Naidu than a real Rajya Sabha contest.

In Manipur, its titular king Sanajaoba Leishemba is the BJP candidate in the Rajya Sabha polls in the state which is currently represented by the BJP state president Kshetrimayum Bhabananda. It became an interesting contest after the Naga People’s Front (NPF) named Honreikhui Kashung as its candidate in addition to Tongbram Mangibabu of the Congress. The NPF is part of BJP-led ruling alliance.

The Congress had won 28 of 60 seats in Manipur in 2017 polls. But the BJP, with 21 MLAs, formed the government with its allies. Later, eight Congress MLAs defected to the BJP. One of them, Thounaojam Shyamkumar, became a minister and was removed by the Supreme Court in an unprecedented ruling only yesterday (March 18). Now, the rest of the seven Congress MLAs say they are with the party itself.

In Meghalaya, the contest for the lone seat is between Kennedy Cornelius Khyiem of the Congress and Wanwei Roy Kharlukhi of the ruling National People’s Party of Conrad Sangma, the state's chief minister.

The Rajya Sabha came into existence in India with the idea of giving representation to collective wisdom of society in the legislative process. The Rajya Sabha was to be represented by elders. It was assumed that such wise persons may not be able to garner enough popular support to get elected to Parliament as the general election demands a lot of canvassing. This very nature of the Rajya Sabha election has undergone a sea change."
Side effects of Covid-19: Why it is oil hoarding time for India,[],"Crude oil prices have been falling in the international markets due to price war and under the impact of novel coronavirus pandemic.

India runs on coal and travels on oil. Oil and coal and their products make up four of top five imports for India. The only exception is centuries-long longing for gold among Indians. In value terms, crude oil is the single largest import contributor and has consistently accounted for more than 20 per cent of India's imports basket.

India imports about 85 per cent of its fuel oil needs. It is the third largest consumer and importer of the crude oil in the world. Any fluctuation in the crude oil prices is bound to impact Indian economy. Inflation, current account deficit (CAD), fiscal deficit and overall GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate gets favourably or adversely impacted.

The RBI estimates that a crude price shock will be followed by high CAD to GDP ratio if price increase is passed on directly to the final consumers, this January 2020 RBI paper says.

There have been suggestions that India should stockpile oil when the prices are favourable in the international markets. The current prices of crude oil present one such situation for India. The crude oil fell below $30 per barrel on Monday. On Wednesday, the prices fell below $26 per barrel. The last time crude oil prices had fallen to $26 per barrel level in 2016 after which it started increasing. In January, the crude oil was selling at $70 per barrel.

Indian government has decided to increase its strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) by buying oil from Saudi Arabia and UAE, the principal players responsible for sharp cut in crude oil prices due to rivalry between the factions of oil exporting countries. Saudi Arabia increased its oil output from less than 10 million barrels a day to 13 million barrels per day.

The favourable oil situation for India is punctuated by the novel coronavirus spread. It has reduced demand for oil sharply in many countries. It is time for India to gain in oil.

India's current SPR or crude oil reserve is about 39 million barrels stored at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Padur in Karnataka. The oil ministry is reported to have sought clearance from the finance ministry for buying over 22 million barrels for which it has placed a demand for $673 million. This much oil is enough for three weeks at current consumption rate in India (2.45 lakh barrels a day).

Since the market experts are of the opinion that the oil prices due to ongoing rivalry and side-effects of novel coronavirus pandemic may continue to dip. This will hit the oil producing countries severely and they will intend to increase the prices of crude oil when normalcy returns to the market in coming weeks and months. This is an added reason why India must resort to oil hoarding when its economy is in a deep downward spiral."
Are we staring at a global recession as economic cost of novel coronavirus pandemic?,[],"An elderly woman, found positive for novel coronavirus, is looking through the window of her isolation room in Washington's Kirkland. Covid-19 is not only threatening human lives but has triggered a fear of global economic recession. (Photo: PTI)

Two major global ratings agencies have downgraded India's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate for 2020 in two days. Both have attributed the cut in India's economic growth forecast to the spread of novel coronavirus. And, India is the only country likely to pay a heavy economic cost of novel coronavirus pandemic.

Moody's on Tuesday marginally cut down India's GDP growth rate for 2020 from its February projection of 5.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent. Moody's had already slashed the growth forecast from 6.6 per cent to 5.4 in February.

On the other hand, S&P Global Ratings lowered India's growth forecast of India from 5.7 per cent to 5.2 per cent for 2020. The agency said not just India but the whole world could be in a deep recession under the impact of novel coronavirus pandemic.

The problem is bigger for India particularly as the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the world when it was already in a prolonged phase of economic slowdown. The country had just registered a seven-year low GDP growth rate of 4.7 per cent in September-December 2019 quarter when novel coronavirus hit world's economy beginning from the global manufacturing and supply hub of China.

Novel coronavirus pandemic is already causing shutdowns in sector after sector. The travel and tourism industry is staring down the barrel with little light at the end. This has impacted the hotel industry badly. Even the medical sector, a provider of good amount of employment, has been badly hit in India.

Though official records will take time to come out, industry estimates in India suggest that the aviation sector has seen up to 75 per cent drop in international bookings and 20 per cent in domestic bookings.

Layoffs had already begun by February. Major travel agency Expedia laid off 3,000 employees globally to compensate the losses caused by novel coronavirus outbreak then.

https://www.businesstoday.in/buzztop/buzztop-corporate/expedia-to-lay-off-3000-employees-as-coronavirus-hits-travel-industry/story/397040.html

The United States has seen sudden spike in layoffs across the country. Reports indicate the sharpest rise in unemployment in the US since the Great Recession of 1929-30. Some 45,000 workers have applied for unemployment benefits in Ohio in the US, more than 15,000 in New Jersey and another 8,000 in Connecticut. This is scary as they all suggest layoffs.

Similar reports have come from Spain, Norway, China, South Korea, Italy and a host of other countries. India too is having its share of layoffs. Sporadic reports of layoffs due to novel coronavirus outbreak have been pouring in but there is no consolidated official record of the same. Experts believe that hiring in services sector especially the IT field will be hit by up to 30 per cent due to novel coronavirus outbreak in India.

India has shut down most of its shopping malls and cinema halls in big cities, advised people to stay home as much as possible. Major economic events such as the Indian Premier League have been deferred or curtailed. All these have employment consequences.

According to a report the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) released in the first week of March, the unemployment rate in the shadow of novel coronavirus outbreak in India hit a four-month high of 7.78 per cent.

Growth projections for India have been declining in the past eight-nine months. Almost every revision of growth forecast by agencies has downgraded the GDP growth projection.

According to the latest report of SBI Research released on Tuesday, the novel coronavirus-induced lockdowns could bring down India's GDP by almost 1 percentage point (0.9 per cent). This comes on account of a 5 per cent inoperability shock from travel, tourism and hotel industries. The SBI Research paper says the impact could be larger in 2020-21.

There is a rush world over to announce economy boosters. The US has announced multi-billion dollar impetus and rate cuts, many countries in Europe have announced tax cuts, the RBI in India did not alter the rates to maintain stability in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak but it may announce a cut of up to 50 basis points in April to give a fillip to the market.

Stock markets the world over are crashing, wiping out crores of rupees. In India, the Sensex has lost around 10,000 points in less than a month. The accurate impact of the novel coronavirus is still months away from assessment but the contagion looks set to bring in a new global recession."
Justice Ranjan Gogoi as Rajya Sabha MP: Law Commission report explains what is wrong here,[],"In the backdrop of Opposition party leaders and activists criticising the move, Justice Ranjan Gogoi has defended the Narendra Modi government's move to nominate him to the Rajya Sabha only four months after his retirement as the Chief Justice of India. He linked the nomination to the process of nation-building.

This is what he said in Guwahati: ""I accepted it since I am confident that the legislature and the judiciary must at some point of time work together for nation-building. My presence in the Parliament would be an opportunity to underline the views of the judiciary before the lawmakers and vice- versa.""

There is no law or constitutional provision that prohibits such a nomination. Nor is this an unprecedented decision by the government. Still, it is not a common practice that a government nominates or appoints a former Supreme Court judge or even a high court judge to some office within months of her or his retirement.

But there is a recommendation of the Law Commission of India that considered the question of such nominations and appointments before forming a negative opinion. It was the 14th report of the Law Commission of India, and was made in 1958 when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the prime minister of the country.

In paragraph 28 of the report, the Law Commission says, ""we have noticed the only bar imposed on a Judge of the Supreme Court who has retired is that he shall not thereafter plead or act in any Court or before any authority. In the result some Supreme Court Judges have, after retirement, set up chamber practice while some others have found employment in important positions under the Government. We have grave doubts whether starting chamber practice after retirement is consistent with the dignity of these retired judges and consonant with the high traditions which retired judges observe in other countries.""

Paragraph 29 of the same report of the Law Commission is more direct saying, ""But there can be no doubt that it is clearly undesirable that Supreme Court Judges should look forward to other Government employment after their retirement.""

Explaining the reason for why Supreme Court judges should resist such offers from the government, the Law Commission report says, ""The Government is a party in a large number of causes [cases] in the highest Court and the average citizen may well get the impression, that a judge who might look forward to being employed by the Government after his retirement, does not bring to bear on his work that detachment of outlook which is expected of a judge in cases in which Government is a party.""

""We are clearly of the view that the practice has a tendency to affect the independence of the judges and should be discontinued,"" the Law Commission concluded.

This report was never implemented.

Justice Ranjan Gogoi headed the benches of the Supreme Court that decided politically volatile cases such as the Rafale deal and the Ayodhya title dispute. Both cases ended in judgments that suited the BJP, the party ruling at the Centre.

In the Rafale deal case, the Congress alleged malfeasance with then party president Rahul Gandhi accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having been personally involved. The case was settled during the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election. In Ayodhya title dispute case, the BJP favoured construction of a Ram temple at the site where Mughal era Babri Masjid stood till 1992. The case was decided days before Justice Gogoi retired in November 2019.

Justice Gogoi's case is not an exception though.

Former CJI P Sathasivam became Kerala governor in 2014 within four months of his retirement from the Supreme Court. Incidentally, he was on the bench that decided a fake encounter case in which Amit Shah, now the Union home minister, had been named. Amit Shah had got a clean chit in that case.

Two more such cases became national headlines. One was of Justice Sunil Gaur of the Delhi High Court. On August 20 in 2019, Justice Gaur dismissed Former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram's petition seeking protection from arrest in a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

In his verdict, Justice Gaur had held Chidambaram as a potential ""kingpin"" of the money laundering scandal involving INX Media. This ruling led to arrest of Chidambaram.

Justice Gaur retired on August 23 and within a week, was appointed the chairman of the Appellate Tribunal for the PMLA. Besides, he had also dealt with the cases of VVIP chopper scam and National Herald in which Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were named.

The other controversy involved former Supreme Court judge Justice AK Sikri, who had been nominated by the government to an international tribunal. Justice Sikri was on the panel that removed then CBI chief Alok Verma in 2019 in the middle of a virtual war within the agency.

Justice Sikri sided with PM Modi's or the government's opinion in removing Verma. The other member of the panel was Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress who was against removing the CBI chief, a post which is otherwise protected under the law.

But the Modi government is not the only one in roping in Supreme Court judges.

There is a long list of justices having been ""favoured"" by the government of the day. Former CJI M Hidayatullah was appointed the vice president in 1979 nine years after his retirement. Justice Bahrul Islam was nominated to the Rajya Sabha some five months after he resigned from the Supreme Court. Both decisions were taken by the Indira Gandhi government.

In 1998, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister, the Congress under Sonia Gandhi nominated former CJI Rangnath Misra for the Rajya Sabha election.

Meanwhile, former CJI TS Thakur declined the Aam Aadmi Party's offer to contest the Rajya Sabha election in 2017.

Appointments and nominations of retired judges have been happening for decades. In most cases, those in Opposition have been voicing against the practice taking high moral ground. The Congress and other Opposition parties are doing right now what BJP leaders earlier did.

Former union finance and law minister late Arun Jaitley had said in 2012: ""There are two kinds of judges - those who know the law and those who know the law minister"" before adding, ""Pre-retirement judgements are influenced by post-retirement jobs.""

Two key suggestions have come in recent times. Then in Opposition, Nitin Gadkari - now a powerful Union minister - had suggested a two-year cooling-off period for the judges before they could take up a position under the government. Former CJI RM Lodha suggested creation of a pool of retired judges who are willing to take up post-retirement jobs."
Rajasthan Deputy CM Sachin Pilot steps in to save revolt-hit Gujarat Congress,[],"The Congress seems to have tasked Sachin Pilot, the Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister, to ensure that Gujarat Congress does not follow the footsteps of Madhya Pradesh unit. Sachin Pilot met the Congress MLAs from Gujarat in Jaipur's Shiv Vilas hotel on Tuesday as the party frantically tried to keep its flock together ahead of the Rajya Sabha election.

The Congress had on Monday completed shifting 67 of its 68 MLAs from Gujarat to the Rajasthan capital. Five of the Congress MLAs have already resigned and the Congress, in reaction, suspended them. The party originally had 73 MLAs in the Gujarat Assembly.

PTI on Monday reported that the one Congress MLA was unreachable to the party. Jitu Chaudhary has kept his mobile phones switched off and remained incommunicado.

Intervention of Sachin Pilot in Gujarat Congress crisis is significant in the view that focus had shifted on him following the rebellion of Jyotiraditya Scindia who recently quit the Congress along with 22 party MLAs in Madhya Pradesh. Scindia joined the BJP and got a Rajya Sabha nomination. The rebellion in Madhya Pradesh also cost the Congress a Rajya Sabha seat in the election scheduled for March 26.

Scindia and Pilot were considered close in the Congress and part of Team Rahul. Both had been sulking in their respective states - Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan - where the Congress snatched power from the BJP in the 2018 assembly elections. Both had to sacrifice their chief ministerial ambitions to accommodate the old guard - Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot respectively.

While Pilot got the post of deputy CM, Scindia was pushed to the margins. Both had gone in public criticizing the incumbent chief ministers. Scindia quit and the focus was on Pilot, who too was reportedly feeling uncomfortable with the current state of affairs in the party.

Meanwhile, another rebellion broke out in the Congress with five MLAs tendering resignations in two days. This meant the Congress cannot win more than one of the four Rajya Sabha seats up for grabs in Gujarat.

The Congress looked up to Rajasthan to bring order in the chaotic house of Gujarat Congress. Ashok Gehlot is a veteran in the Congress. But Sachin Pilot was entrusted with the responsibility to ensure that there is no more breach in the Congress's dam.

This may have a ripple effect in Rajasthan. Sachin Pilot could be the potential rallying point for such a rebellion in the Rajasthan Congress, which has been edgy ever since Gehlot failed to win a single seat for the party from the state in 2019 Lok Sabha election.

Sachin Pilot coming to meet the Congress MLAs from Gujarat is likely to soothe the nerves of the disillusioned party leaders from the neighbouring state. This appears to be the Congress's attempt to assert that Scindia was an exception.

The last Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat in 2017 had seen similar pattern of reisngations, and more defection through cross voting. The Congress fears cross voting by its MLAs this time as well.

Earlier, the Congress was sure of winning two seats in the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat. It needed 74 votes for that which became possible after Independent MLA Jignesh Mewani announced his support. As a result, the Congress fielded senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki for the Rajya Sabha election.

The BJP too had announced two candidates, Abhay Bhardwaj and Ramila Bara initially. In a last-minute announcement, the BJP named Narhari Amin, who was earlier with the Congress, as its third candidate. What followed was a slew of resignations. To win three Rajya Sabha seats, the BJP needs 111 votes. It has 103 of its own."
Coronavirus threat: Elderly more at risk but kids are not immune to Covid-19,[],"Novel coronavirus infections have proved more problematic for elderly people while children have been mildly affected by the pandemic. (Photos: PTI)

Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones.

Situation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems.

The mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.

China too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The WHO Q&A on coronavirus reads, "" While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.""

In India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.



This has given an impression that children are safe and unaffected by coronavirus outbreak. But this does not present the complete picture.

Two main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.

Secondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus.

With stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.

China found that the 10-19 age group formed just one per cent of total novel coronavirus infection. Those below 10 comprised had a less than one per cent share. No death has been reported in the age group.

This does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.

But the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children."
"Coronavirus pandemic: How the world has dealt with Covid-19, could it have done better?",[],"Coronavirus pandemic has created a panic across the world particularly after the WHO said Europe has become the new epicentre of Covid-19. (Photo: PTI)

It looks like a world war against a virus. The novel coronavirus which has acquired pandemic scale both in its spread and declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Now, for the first time, the rest of the world has more coronavirus cases than China, the source region.

The total number of Covid-19 patients in the world has crossed 1.67 lakh with China accounting for less than 82,000, according to WHO's latest report. While the world reported 13,903 cases in preceding 24 hours. Only 29 of these were reported from China.

The WHO has already declared Europe as the new epicentre of coronavirus pandemic. Incidentally, it was only after the theatre of pandemic shifted from oriental landscape to Europe that the more dominant powers appeared serious in tackling the contagion. Here is an account of how the world has dealt with coronavirus pandemic.

INSULATION

The United States has suspended all flights from Europe. President Donald Trump is expected to declare national emergency. Many European countries such as Germany, France and Britain have followed a similar strategy to insulate themselves. This method has worked for many less developed countries such as Magnolia, which is surrounded by China from three sides, North Korea, located like cheese between the slices of South Korea and China, two of the worst affected countries in the world.

India too imposed massive travel restrictions. India began screening of passengers coming to India in the final week of February. The vigil was up not only at airports but also at the sea ports. The government said more than 27,000 people were not allowed to land in India at sea ports as the paths of the ships had crossed coronavirus affected countries.

In nut shell, country-quantine is the most preferred method adopted by various governments to check spread of Covid-19.

EACH ONE ON ITS OWN

Covid-19 is a pandemic both in its scale of spread and by the declaration of the WHO. However, it is peculiar that there has not been attempts by leading countries to devise a common and coordinated strategy to fight the contagion.

China called for international cooperation in early February. The WHO too called for a concerted global effort. But all countries ultimately devised their own specific strategy to deal with coronavirus spread.

When the Donald Trump administration suspended flight operations from Europe, the decision was criticised for having been unilateral in nature. Italy, Iran and other worse affected countries felt constrained in dealing with the crisis leading to sudden spike in the cases of Covid-19.

India, however, showed some initiative recently with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosting a video-conference with the leaders of the Saarc. Decision was taken to create a Saarc fund to fight coronavirus spread. Such attempts taken in the initial days might have kept the novel coronavirus in check to a large extent.

COVER UP

Another tactic reportedly adopted by some countries was of underreporting and covering up the coronavirus outbreak. It began with China.

For first two months -- now the first victims of novel coronavirus have been traced back to November 2019 against previously set starting point of mid-December 2019 -- China refused to acknowledge the Covid-19 outbreak.

The doctor who first went public with the reporting of coronavirus outbreak was severely reprimanded by the Chinese government. The first health workers alerting the officials and asking people to beware of this contagion were also reportedly warned for ""rumour mongering"".

Later, that doctor died. Chinese media said he died of Covid-19. This all happened despite Chinese President Xi Jinping telling the public that anyone found hiding the truth would be severely dealt with. Recently, an old aide of Xi Jinping went missing after he criticised the Chinese government for its handling of coronavirus pandemic.

A pattern of cover-up was also seen in Italy and Iran, the two worst affected countries outside the source zone in China-Hong Kong-South Korea. Italian authorities are said to have dismissed the reports of coronavirus in initial days. They responded only after the situation spiralled out of control. The health infrastructure was found to be inadequate in the country. Same has been the case with Iran, which has already been reeling under the impact of multiple sanctions.

In India, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Modi government was in stupor as coronavirus caused havoc in the country. This was an allegation of cover up. Though, the government has been coming out with daily updates on the matter. The government has said that it is on the top of coronavirus situation in the country.

ECONOMIC BOOSTERS

Coronavirus pandemic has challenged the human capital of the world. In equal measure if not more is the pressure that the governments are feeling over their economic capital. The full scale economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is still unknowns but economic boosters are already being announced.

The US Federal Reserve has cut down the interest rate to zero, and announced a mega $700 billion quantitative easing programme as the economy reels under the coronavirus pressure.

The UK has slashed interest rates on loans for small and medium businesses. Germany has announced tax cuts. Australia has announced to pump billions of dollars in its market to avoid coronavirus-induced slowdown.

Italy announced a $28 billion dollar package to strengthen its health infrastructure. The European Commission followed the similar suit. Iran, for the first time in nealy six decades asked for money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In India, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to infuse Rs 1 lakh crore in the market to fight off adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic on Indian businesses. The RBI has not altered the regular banking duties but asked the customers to do more digital transactions to avoid contact with bank employees and keep less pressure on the banking staff."
Scindia spillover: Congress loses 1 Rajya Sabha seat in Gujarat even before election,[],"Days after Jyotiraditya Scindia (seen here with Union Home Minister Amit Shah) joined quit the Congress along with 22 of his supporting MLAs in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is facing similar rebellion in neighbouring Gujarat where the party has fielded Bharatsinh Solanki and Shaktisinh Gohil (seen on the right with party leader Rahul Gandhi) in the Rajya Sabha election.

One of the demands that Jyotiraditya Scindia reportedly raised with the Congress leadership before quitting the party and joining the BJP last week was a Rajya Sabha berth. He did not get that confidence from the Congress leadership. Though, senior party leader Digivijaya Singh later claimed Scindia had been assured of a Rajya Sabha ticket, which the BJP gave him eventually.

In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress-BJP battle began with the fight for the third Rajya Sabha with both parties assured of one seat each. The BJP played smart and now seems to have secured two seats for itself.

The spillover was seen in neighbouring Gujarat, where five Congress MLAs have submitted resignation over the past two days. This has a direct bearing on the Rajya Sabha election scheduled for March 26.

Gujarat will elect four Rajya Sabha members in the biennial election. Each candidate needs the 37 first preferential votes each to win the Rajya Sabha election from Gujarat.

The Congress had 73 MLAs and Independent legislator Jignesh Mewani extended support to the party. This would have ensured two of the four Rajya Sabha seats to the Congress from Gujarat. But five MLAs sent their resignations to Speaker Rajendra Trivedi, a BJP member.

This reduces the Congress's strength in the Assembly to 68 - six short of the required number to win two seats. The Congress has claimed support of three more MLAs - two from Bharatiya Tribal Party and one from the Nationalist Congress Party.

On the other hand, the BJP has 103 members in Gujarat Assembly. It requires 111 votes to win three Rajya Sabha seat. There is speculation that more Congress MLAs may quit to tilt the equation more in favour of the BJP, which in a last-minute decision fielded third candidate for the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat.

The BJP had earlier announced the names of Abhay Bharadwaj and Ramila Bara following which the Congress announced Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki as its Rajya Sabha candidates. It looked a gentleman's game till the BJP decided to field Narhari Amin, a turncoat from the Congress.

What followed is a slew of resignations in a reminder of the 2017 Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat when Ahmed Patel, the political advisor to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, barely scraped through in the face of sizeable defections to the BJP. Amit Shah was the BJP candidate back then. Six Congress MLAs had resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha election, and nine others did not vote for Ahmed Patel.

Three years later, the Congress expected to win two seats comfortably but a late twist to the tale has turned its tide. The BJP now hopes to retain its standing in the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat.

Of the four Rajya Sabha MPs retiring from Gujarat, three belong to the BJP. They are Chunibhai Gohel, Shambhuprasad Tundiya and Lalsinh Vadodiya. The fourth Rajya Sabha MP is Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress.

The Congress has dubbed the MLAs submitting resignations as ""not honest"" but the party shifted about two dozen MLAs from Gujarat to Congress-ruled Rajasthan. In contrast, Gujarat BJP president Jitu Vaghani claimed his party will win three Rajya Sabha seats."
Lest coronavirus suspects and Covid-19 patients land up in jail,[],"The central and state governments in India seem to have unleashed its full might on coronavirus pandemic. Every possible and potential coronavirus suspect is being traced, quarantined or isolated if she turns out to be positive for Covid-19.

Most of the positive novel coronavirus cases in India are sourced from abroad. Though, some second stage infections have also happened. Some experts fear community to community spread, the third stage of outbreak when it becomes really dangerous.

There have been reports that individuals have tried to evade the government authorities tasked with containing the spread of coronavirus in India. This can have serious repercussions. For example, the first person to die of Covid-19 in India was a 75-year-old man who had returned from Saudi Arabia. When he showed symptoms, and was advised coronavirus test, he ignored the same not once but twice.

Similarly, reports point to deliberate attempts to dodge the agencies by some of the suspects including foreign nationals. In one such case, all the passengers were offloaded from a flight in Kerala as a group of foreign tourists had exposure to coronavirus.

A British national in the group had tested positive for coronavirus infection. That person had earlier been advised isolation on the ground of being a Covid-19 suspect. When test reports came, the authorities learnt the person had joined the group of tourist to fly out.

In Uttar Pradesh, authorities have threatened to take legal action against the family of a Covid-19 patient. The family is accused of ""misleading"" the health officials by giving inaccurate travel details, and also of violating the direction for home isolation for 14 days after returning from a country on the red list.

The punitive action flows from the Epidemic Disease Act of 1897, originally framed by the British rulers in India. It had been drafted to fight bubonic plague in then Bombay. Many states have invoked the Epidemic Disease Act after the central government advised to do so.

Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act makes advisories issued by health department enforceable and empowers the state to prosecutie violators. Section 3 of the same law says individuals disobeying regulations are punishable and can be jailed up to one month.

The Uttar Pradesh authorities have said an FIR will be lodged against the family of the Covid-19 under Sections 269 (an act of negligence that is likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 270 (an act of malignance that is likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. These IPC Sections provide for imprisonment up to two years and fine.

The central government has declared coronavirus outbreak a notified disaster. Uttar Pradesh and some affected states have declared coronavirus outbreak epidemic.

With invoking of the Epidemic Act, the district authorities now have the power to enforce regulations inspect those who have travelled to coronavirus affected regions, and segregate the individuals suspected to carry infection by putting them under quarantine at home, hospital or some other place.

The Epidemic Act has been used many times in Independent India. Recent invocattions were in the cases of swine flu and dengue. In 2018, the Vadodara district administration in Gujarat enforced the Epidemic Diseases Act to control spread of cholera.

Invoking the Epidemic Diseases Act points to the evasive tendency among the people with possible coronavirus exposure. Health authorities including in states such as Kerala have expressed their concern saying this ""irrespoinsible"" behaviour by those suspected of coronavirus exposure.

At least three people with travel history to Italy hid this fact from the authorites. They tested positive when forced to undergo medical examination by the authorities who traced them later.

In Odisha, an Irish national placed by authorites under isolation at a government hospital along with another individual quietly fled. The authorities were forced to file complaint against them. Similar instances were reported from Punjab and Jammu."

Anil Singhvi reveals how to combat Coronavirus-hit stock market in March - #FasnaNahiHai,[],"Coronavirus has hit both the global and Indian stock markets. In the last one month, the US Dow Jones has hit lower circuit on four occasions. Before that, the Dow Jones had hit the lower circuit in the year 1997. Following the weak global cues, Indian indices too have crashed to the tune of 25 per cent in the last one month. Indian indices also hit the lower circuit last Friday. Today, the NSE Nifty index had gone down below 8,000 levels while the BSE Sensex crashed over 2,000 points in the opening Bell trade session. In such a free-falling share market, investors need to have a proper strategy for the next 9 trade sessions to come in March 2020. Zee Business Managing Editor Anil Singhvi comes out with a strategy for March 2020 on how to combat the Coronavirus hit the stock market - #FasnaNahiHai.

Anil Singhvi on stock market recovery

According to Anil Singhvi, this stock market crash has not been caused by an economic crisis. It has been caused by a health crisis. When there is an economic crisis, the government chips in by enhancing liquidity, curtailing interest rates, etc. But, in the case of such a health crisis, when around 200 countries have got hit by Coronavirus pandemic, recruiters are forced to ask their workers to sit at home or 'follow work from home' routine rather coming out of one's home. In fact, there is a complete lockdown kind of situation and Anil Singhvi says that it will take time to come out of this crisis. He is advising investors that they should not show any kind of a hurry because all types of market sentiment indicators are negative. On the bailout package announced by the US and some other countries set to follow suit in this regard, Singhvi is quite clear that it won't be enough to combat the Coronavirus-hit stock market.

See Zee Business Live TV streaming below:

Singhvi is of the opinion that the next 15 days are very crucial as India has entered into the third stage of Corovaris - there are 13 days left in the month of March. He said that one should ensure the safety of one's money in this Coronavirus hit stock market rather than making money. In fact, a penny saved is a penny earned in such a free-falling stock market. So, the next 9 trade sessions are crucial for stock market investors as from 1st April, there can be some recovery expected, said Singhvi.

Advising to adopt #FasnaNahiHai strategy, Singhvi said that in the next trading sessions to come in March 2020, the market would lure investors with hopes of a bounceback. However, Singhvi said 'Fasna Nahi Hai'! Why? The market is slowly and steadily reaching the oversold condition. He strictly advised investors to avoid taking any short-position in the markets. In fact, for those who have a buying position, Singhvi advised them to book profit on every rise of 5-7 per cent."
"Save lives and money.... #BandKaroBazaar, Anil Singhvi makes clarion call to shut down stock markets",[],"Coronavirus is affecting both global and domestic markets dearly. In the last month since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the global markets have corrected to the tune of over 20 per cent while the domestic markets have dipped more than 25 per cent. The whole world is taking preventive measures to combat this deadly virus. Both government and private organisations have implemented 'work from home' policy to ensure the safety of their employees. Now, Zee Business Managing Editor Anil Singhvi has given voice to stock market investors and made a clarion call for the closure of the Indian share market as well. Applauded by Market Experts on Air as #BandKaroBazaar being a prize-winning campaign, Basant Maheshwari, Market Expert; Ajay Bagga, Market Expert; VK Sharma, HDFC Securities, Sanjeev Bhasin, IIFL Securities amongst many others have strongly supported the same.

While moderating a program on the Zee Business TV, Anil Singhvi pointed out the impact of Coronavirus on the Indian indices and suggested SEBI and the government to think about closing the Indian stock market and focus fully on combating Coronavirus. Singhvi said that in this volatile share market, a smart stock market investor needs to safeguard both his life and wealth.

See Zee Business Live TV streaming below:

Singhvi said that the concerned authorities must act quickly to take a call on shutting down the Indian stock market.

On why the stock market has to be shut down, Singhvi said, ""Work from home is possible for various organisations (both government and private) but for the stock market, it's impossible."" He said that there is no such technique available in current circumstances where the stock market can be run by asking its employees to work from home.

To ensure a big momentum is built for this demand, Zee Business has initiated a social media campaign to shut down the market with this hash tag - #BandKaroBazaar. This has started trending on Twitter now. In fact, Zee Business is also conducting a social media poll on whether the stock market should be shut down. People can freely participate in this poll. The poll is available on the Twitter and Facebook accounts of Zee Business.

After Zee Business made this call to shut down the stock market, #BandKaroBazaar has started trending globally while in India, it's the second most trending call on Twitter."
"#IndiaFightsCorona: Modi government's big decision to increase liquidity, enhance market confidence",[],"Amid comprehensive preparations to curb coronavirus spread in India, Modi government has taken a big decision! In a major development, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced that it would purchase government securities worth Rs 10,000 crore through open market operations (OMO). The important step has been taken in a bid to increase liquidity and enhance confidence in the market amid the coronavirus crisis.

What RBI said?

- In a statement, the RBI said that with the heightening of Covid-19 pandemic risks, certain financial market segments have been experiencing a tightening of financial conditions as reflected in the hardening of yields and widening of spreads.

- ""It is important to ensure that all market segments remain liquid and stable, and function normally.""

- ""On a review of the current liquidity and financial conditions, the Reserve Bank has decided to conduct open market operations on March 20, 2020 (Friday) in the form of purchase of an aggregate amount of Rs 10,000 crore of the following Government securities through a multi-security auction using the multiple price method.""

- Under the scheme, the RBI will purchase government securities maturing in between 2022 and 2025. The securities were issued with a coupon rate of 8.2 per cent, 7.37 per cent, 7.32 per cent and 7.72 per cent.

- The RBI statement said: ""There is no notified amount against any of these securities within the aggregate ceiling of Rs 10,000 crore set for the operation.

- ""The central bank reserves the right to decide on the quantum of purchase of individual securities, accept offers for less than or higher than the aggregate amount of Rs 10,000 crore and also to accept or reject any or all offers either wholly or partially without assigning any reason,"" it added.

Meanwhile, coronavirus fears continue to rattle financial markets across the world and concerns have been raised over the economic impact of the pandemic.

The RBI has said it is ready to take measures required to calm the markets and improve liquidity."

While government, companies and individuals are taking precautions at different levels, financial health becomes of utmost importance in this scenario – especially if there is a medical emergency. In such case, here is how you can arrange instant funds –

Dig into your savings – Money saved will be of great importance in the next few weeks. If anyone in your family needs medical attention, dig into your savings and use for emergency fund to deal with the situation.

Loan against investments – With markets crashing, the value of your investments is likely to have decreased and this won’t be the right time to redeem them. However, the smart approach would be to take a loan against your investments like fixed deposits, RDs, mutual funds and more.

Borrow from friends – In case money in bank and investments are not enough and you are forced to borrow, turn towards your friends or family first. This will save you from all the paper work and provide quick money.

Opt for Personal Loan – If the money required is more, you can opt for a personal loan with a short repayment period.

New Delhi: Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus on Wednesday unveiled the company's refreshed visual identity, including an updated logo. The updates mark the most significant change to the OnePlus brand since the company was founded in December 2013.

The logo introduces a new curvilinear ""1"" that is easier to read while adjusting the weight of the logotype for better overall balance.

The ""+"" in the surrounding box has also been enlarged and is now more prominent, in a nod to the OnePlus community, which has played a key role in the company's ongoing success.

""OnePlus is not changing who we are, but reinforcing what we stand for - the true spirit of 'Never Settle',"" said Mats Hakansson, Global Creative Director of OnePlus.

""We always design for our users. We feel that these changes maintain the iconic elements of our brand that are beloved by our staff and our community while injecting both excitement and balance into our visual identity,"" Hakansson added.

According to the company, the refreshed logo creates a clearer association between the symbol and the trademark, while also allowing for more flexible application and improved recognisability in digital media.

The visual identity is accompanied by a fresh colour palette which centres on OnePlus's iconic red, followed by an updated secondary palette of cyan, green, magenta, indigo, and yellow to make the company's design and assets more vibrant and lively.

A new font also improves legibility and is easier on the eyes, the company said in a statement.

""No detail is too small. By starting from thousands of user data points, the team arrived at a new holistic visual language inspired by OnePlus' burdenless philosophy,"" Hakansson said.

""OnePlus has grown a lot from an idea to a major smartphone player. Introducing a fresh new look is just one example of how we continue to bring our 'Never Settle' mantra to life,"" Hakansson added.

WION Edit: Coronavirus outbreak - why the private sector needs to contribute,[],"The coronavirus pandemic is fundamentally changing our societies - people are working from home, the streets are virtually empty, public spaces have been shut and experts are advising against social interactions.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has laid great emphasis on testing, they advice testing every suspected case. Enhanced testing has been the backbone of every successful coronavirus response.

In India, more than 50 labs are functional, but the number is a drop in the ocean for India. So what should the government do? Desperate times call for desperate measures.



Also Read: India ably tackles coronavirus outbreak

Take the case of Spain, only a fraction of India's size and population, the government has decided to take over private healthcare services.

The entire Spanish healthcare system has been nationalised to deal with the crisis. All private health providers and their facilities are now under government control.

The government can now even order a requisition of face masks and Covid-19 tests. Other countries are mulling different forms of nationalisation.

France might take over big companies if it's necessary. Germany too is thinking about supporting pharmaceutical companies.

In America, there is a call to take over critical private-sector health companies. The Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, has asked the American government to take control of key firms.

South Korea scaled up its testing by involving the private sector. The MERS outbreak in 2015 had killed 38 in South Korea. At that time, South Korea enacted a key reform.

It allowed the government an almost instantaneous approval to gain access to testing systems. For the coronavirus outbreak, 90 per cent of the testing has been done by the private sector in South Korea.

India could adopt a similar strategy to ramp-up its fight against the Wuhan virus. Services of the private sector could be requisitioned. Already, accredited private labs have been allowed to test for Covid-19.

There is a tight watch on supplies. Earlier this month, India had blocked the export of some essential drugs. A move to ensure adequate supply during the coronavirus outbreak.

Countries around the world are making a case for nationalisation. Indian government might as well consider some form of regulation for the health sector. It seems to be the only way to deal with shortages.

India must dramatically scale up its efforts to contain the coronavirus. And it's time for the private players to do their bit. We must learn from Air India. The dying national carrier and its staff, evacuating Indians stranded in all parts of the world.

Playing for higher stakes: Saudi Arabia gambles on oil war with Russia,[],"Saudi Arabia’s oil spat with Russia throws a spanner into the works of the Kingdom’s long-standing effort to hedge its bets, a strategy that has taken on added significance as the Gulf comes to grips with the likelihood that the region’s security architecture will fundamentally change.

Saudi Arabia, despite a primary focus on close ties to the United States, has increasingly sought to put its eggs in multiple baskets by initially forging closer military and economic relations with Britain, France, and Germany, and more recently with Russia and China.

Saudi Arabia has increasingly sought to put its eggs in multiple baskets, forging closer military and economic relations with Russia and China.

The Saudi strategy, stemming from mounting doubts about the reliability of the United States as an ally and protector of last resort, was showcased when China opened its first overseas defence production facility in Saudi Arabia for the manufacturing of the CH-4 Caihong or Rainbow drone, as well as associated equipment.

The CH-4 is comparable to the US armed MQ-9 Reaper drone that Washington has refused to sell to the Kingdom.

Saudi Arabia’s willingness to undermine its hedging strategy by challenging Russia’s refusal to continue to align its production levels with that of the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) follows the Kingdom’s bowing to US pressure to acquire Lockheed Martin’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system rather than Russia’s S-400 anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapon.

Putin made a last-ditch sales pitch last September after the Kingdom’s six battalions of US-made Patriot batteries failed to detect drone and missile attacks on two of the country’s key oil facilities that knocked out half of its production capacity.

The decision by Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials MBS, to confront Russia stemmed from a stark choice confronting the Crown Prince: endanger relations with the only power to have put forward a regional security plan that would have allowed the Kingdom to hedge its bets while maintaining close ties to the United States, or drive oil prices down in a bid to force Russia to coordinate production levels that would ensure a higher price.

Ultimately, the Crown Prince’s choice was driven by economics rather than long-term security.

Low oil prices have already forced the Kingdom to borrow from international financial markets. $80 per barrel is the price it needs to balance its budget. It is also the price MBS needs for his ambitious plans to diversify and streamline the Saudi economy and turn it into a cutting edge 21st-century knowledge hub.

MBS may in some respects have shot himself in the foot even if his assumption proves correct that the Kingdom could win a price and production war and that Russian President Vladimir Putin would see a longer-term move from a unipolar to a multilateral security arrangement in the Gulf as too big a prize to lose.

Last year’s limited initial public offering (IPO) on the Saudi stock exchange by Aramco, the Kingdom’s national oil company, that constituted a crown jewel in MBS’ economic reform plans, failed to convincingly address fears that it was subject to the whims of the Kingdom’s ruling elite.

The oil war with Russia may have convinced investors’ worst fears with Aramco raising capacity and production to help MBS with his gamble.

“This has proved to investors that their worst fears about Aramco were a reality. The company’s plans and its output decisions are based on MBS’ erratic behaviour,” said a Saudi official familiar with Aramco’s offering.

MBS may not be the only one to suffer consequences of the oil war, but his may be a tougher struggle because it involves restoration of trust.

The setback for US Shale oil companies that need a relatively high oil price to break even, the reason Russia was willing to go to war with Saudi Arabia, is likely to be temporary as was evident in 2014 when Saudi Arabia gunned for market share rather than price to drive American producers out of business.

“A protracted crude oil price war on the supply side, combined with the simultaneous demand shock caused by Covid-19’s impact on economic activity, will hurt oil producers everywhere,” said Tilak K Doshi, an energy scholar at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute.

If the Crown Prince’s decision was driven by domestic considerations, so was Putin’s.

Yet, despite believing that OPEC had outlived its utility, Putin was taken aback by the ferocity of Saudi Arabia’s response to the Russian cancellation of its earlier production level agreement with OPEC, prompting Moscow to call for a return to the agreed levels for the first quarter of this year.

“OPEC is finished, so is any attempt to ‘manage’ the oil market. US shale (as a fully privately owned industry) operates on aggressive free-market principals. The Russians understand that and so does Saudi. The energy game (including alternatives) is now a survival of the fittest,” tweeted Ali Shihabi, a banker-turned-pro-Saudi-political commentator.

In Russia, MBS is up against an opponent that could prove to have a long breath."

Australia put into effect ""Level 4: Do not travel"" to any country in the world official advice including a ban on any ""non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people"".

""Life is changing in Australia, as it is changing all around the world,"" Morrison said at a news conference, adding, ""Life is going to continue to change, as we deal with the global coronavirus. This is a once in a hundred-year type event.""

Australia's Qantas airline had earlier announced that it had stopped all international flights and suspended 20,000 staff due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Sachin Tendulkar urges everyone to draw lessons from Test cricket to tackle COVID-19,[],"The novel coronavirus has taken the entire world under its dreaded wings. In India, the total number of positive cases of COVID-19 stand at 166 as of Thursday morning. Due to the deadly virus, the entire sporting calendar has been shredded into pieces with all the high profile tournaments getting either cancelled or postponed. Former Indian cricketer and a legend of the gentlemen’s game Sachin Tendulkar on Thursday expressed his emotions in this dire situation as he asked everyone to draw lessons from Test cricket.

Tendulkar said that Test cricket always rewards players for respecting what they don’t understand while adding the longest and oldest format of the game makes one value the virtue of patience. The Little Master further said that that defence becomes the best form of attack when the conditions are tough for a batsman in Test cricket as he urged everyone to remain patient and be on the back-foot.

“Cricket is a unique sport. Most sports compete against other sports for fans’ attention, but cricket competes with ever-evolving versions of itself. There has been much debate about the relevance of Test Cricket in the fast-paced T20 world. While the world battles the Covid-19 pandemic, this is probably the time for all of us to draw lessons from the grand old format of the game,” Tendulkar wrote in a column for a leading daily.

“Test cricket rewards you for respecting what you don’t understand. It makes you value the virtue of patience. When you don’t understand the pitch conditions or the bowler, defence becomes the best form of attack,” Tendulkar added.

Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, Tendulkar further said that he never though he would witness anything like this in his entire lift. However, the Master Blaster added that like in Test cricket, it is about partnership and teamwork, and that is what everyone needs to do in a bid to defeat the novel coronavirus.

“Patience is what we require now, if we have to defend well. In my entire life as a professional cricketer and beyond, I never thought I would see anything like this. Cricket in India and globally has come to a complete standstill,” Tendulkar advised.

“To use a cricketing metaphor, while individual brilliance can help a team in shorter formats of the game, in Test cricket it is all about partnerships and teamwork. If a batter faces the easy overs and keeps letting partners take on the menacing bowlers, then he or she may score runs and remain unbeaten, but the innings will collapse. This is a valuable lesson for us to learn from,” Sachin further wrote in the column.

While the situation continues to deteriorate with each passing day, the medical authorities are doing their best to curb the situation. However, the responsibility lies on the hands of respective individuals to follow the advisory and maintain social distancing and self-isolation as much as possible.

Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi takes oath as Rajya Sabha MP amid protests,[],"New Delhi: Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday took oath as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha amidst unprecedented scenes of opposition members shouting slogans and walking out of the House.

This is the first time ever that the House has witnessed slogan shouting and walkout during oath-taking.

Gogoi, 65, who retired as the Chief Justice of India in November last year after a tenure of 13 months, took oath in English in the name of God. As his name was called for oath-taking, Congress and Left members started shouting slogans like ‘Shame on You’ and ‘Deal.’

Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu ordered that the slogan-shouting will not go on record.

As Gogoi took the oath, Congress, Left and their allies shouted slogans and staged a walkout from the House. Naidu said it was not fair to shout slogans. “It is very unbecoming of members of Parliament.”

“No, this is not the way. Nothing will go on record. (It is) very unfair, very unfair,” Naidu said as Gogoi completed his oath.

After taking oath, Gogoi walked up to the chair to greet Naidu, who responded to his greetings with folded hands. Naidu said members have the liberty to express their views outside the House on the issue.

“You know the Constitutional provision, you know the precedent, you know the power of the President (to nominate a member to Rajya Sabha),” he said.

“You should not do anything in the House. Whatever views you have you are at liberty to express outside,” he said.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who was among the first to greet Gogoi when he entered the House minutes before the proceedings began, said what opposition members did was “grossly unfair”.

“This House has a great tradition of having many eminent persons coming from diverse fields including former justices nominated by those who have shouted today,” Prasad said.

“Hon’ble member Gogoi, who has taken oath today, will surely contribute his best as a nominated member. And it was grossly unfair to do like this,” he said.

Naidu said, “We must respect a member.” Gogoi was nominated to Rajya Sabha by President Ram Nath Kovind. He was nominated in the vacancy created after the retirement of KTS Tulsi.

Earlier, Gogoi entered the House from the Chariman’s chamber and greeted members present with folded hands. Prasad greeted him with a loud “welcome Gogoi dada”.

Shortly thereafter he was escorted to his designated seat in the second last row where he sat quietly alongside Sonal Mansingh, another nominated member of the House.

During Gogoi’s 13-month tenure, the Supreme Court delivered landmark judgements in the Ayodhya case, on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the entry of women in Kerala’s Sabarimala temple and the Rafale jet deal along with Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The Congress has argued that Gogoi’s nomination to Rajya Sabha “within four months” of his retirement will shake the confidence and faith people have in the independence of the judiciary.

PDS beneficiaries can lift 6-month quota of grains in one go: Ram Vilas Paswan amid coronavirus concerns,[],"PDS beneficiaries can lift 6-month quota of grains in one go: Ram Vilas Paswan amid coronavirus concerns

New Delhi: Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Wednesday said 75 crore beneficiaries under the public distribution system will be allowed to lift their quota of subsidised foodgrains for six months in one go, amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Currently, beneficiaries are lifting grains in advance for maximum two months, while the Punjab government is already distributing six-month quota in one go, he said.

“We have enough foodgrains in our godowns. We have asked state governments and Union Territories to distribute six-month quota of grains to the poor in one go,” Paswan told PTI.

Against the backdrop of rising coronavirus infections, the decision seeks to ensure that poor people have enough foodgrains in the event of possible restrictions that could lead to difficulty in getting the supplies.

The Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the lifting of more grains in one go will ease pressure on central storage as some quantity of wheat is kept in the open.

The government has surplus foodgrains of 435 lakh tonne as of now, of which 272.19 lakh tonne is rice and 162.79 lakh tonne is wheat, he said.

1अप्रैल 2020 तक PDS के माध्यम से दिए जाने वाले अनाज में चावल 135.8 लाख टन और गेहूं 74.6 लाख टन की आवश्यकता है। कुल 210.4 लाख टन अनाज की जरूरत है जबकि अभी हमारे पास कुल स्टॉक 646.09 लाख टन है। मतलब हमारे पास अनाज का 435.69 लाख टन अतिरिक्त स्टॉक मौजूद है। 1/3 @narendramodi — Ram Vilas Paswan (@irvpaswan) March 18, 2020

The PDS requirement for April is about 135 lakh tonne of rice and 74.2 lakh tonne of wheat, the minister said adding the government has enough supply to meet the demand and states can lift the quota in advance.

इसमें चावल 272.90 और गेहूं 162.79 लाख टन है। केन्द्र के सर्कुलर के मुताबिक राज्य सरकारें एक बार में 6 महीने तक के लिए PDS का अनाज ले सकती हैं।अभी पंजाब सरकार 6 महीने का और ओडिशा सरकार एक बार में 2 महीने का कोटा ले रही है।अन्य सरकारें भी चाहें तो अनाज ले सकती हैं 2/3 @narendramodi — Ram Vilas Paswan (@irvpaswan) March 18, 2020

Paswan said the Centre has issued an advisory to state governments for taking necessary safety measures to manage the crowd at ration shops in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

At present, the government supplies 5 kilograms of subsidised foodgrains per month to each beneficiary under the PDS through 5,00,000 ration shops in the country. This costs the exchequer about Rs 1.4 lakh crore annually.

अनाज की न कोई कमी है और न इसको लेकर कोई घबराहट है। इसके अलावा खुले बाजार में भी OMSS के माध्यम से बिक्री हो रही है, जिसमें चावल का भाव 22.50 रुपये प्रति किलो है। 3/3 @narendramodi — Ram Vilas Paswan (@irvpaswan) March 18, 2020

Foodgrains via ration shops are supplied at a highly subsidised rate of Rs 3/kg for rice, Rs 2/kg for wheat and Rs 1/kg for coarse grains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

The Centre is closely monitoring the prices of soaps, floor cleaners and thermal scanners because of surge in demand of these items amid growing coronavirus cases in the country, added Paswan.

Normally, the Consumer Affairs Ministry keeps track of prices of 22 essential commodities. Recently, the ministry included face masks and hand sanitizers under the Essential Commodities Act.

“We are monitoring prices of three more products — soap, floor and hand cleaners like Lizol and Dettol as well as thermal scanners whose demand has gone up because of coronavirus scare,” Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Paswan told PTI.

The prices of these products will be monitored from 114 centres across the country.

Paswan said the government will bring these three products under the Essential Commodities Act if their prices shoot up from the level which prevailed in the last six months.

Hand sanitizers and face masks are now essential items, and stringent action will be taken against those hoarding and black marketing these products, he added.

The minister said the government will monitor more products in the coming days if prices go up substantially.

The 22 commodities which the government monitors includes five items groups — food grains (rice, wheat, atta), pulses (gram, tur, urad, moong, masur), edible oils (groundnut oil, mustard oil, vanaspati, soya oil, sunflower oil, palm oil), vegetables (potato, onion, tomato) and other items (sugar, gur, milk, tea, salt).

According to Paswan, there is high awareness about COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak among people, and the severity of outbreak in India is less as compared with other countries.

"Twitter bans misinforming COVID19 tweets, FB puts corona info on top",[],"San Francisco: Twitter on Thursday said it has expanded its safety rules on fake and mischievous coronavirus content that could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19.

Twitter will require people to remove tweets that include content that increases the chance that someone contracts or transmits the virus.

“It includes denial of expert guidance, encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques and misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities,” the micro-blogging platform said in a statement.

Vijaya Gadde, global lead for legal, policy, and trust and safety at Twitter said the company is increasing its use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and manipulative content.

Here is some new guidance on how Twitter will handle misleading and harmful content about COVID-19. Full details, examples, and more information are on our blog:https://t.co/xyqFnw28jS — Vijaya Gadde (@vijaya) March 19, 2020

Twitter will take action on tweets “denying global or local health authority recommendations to decrease someone’s likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 with the intent to influence people into acting against recommended guidance, such as: “social distancing is not effective.”

“It includes Description of treatments or protective measures which are not immediately harmful but are known to be ineffective, are not applicable to the COVID-19 context, or are being shared with the intent to mislead others.”

It will look into tweets that deny “established scientific facts about transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance from global and local health authorities, such as COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven’t seen any cases of children being sick,” said Gadde.

Twitter will purge tweets with “specific and unverified claims that incite people to action and cause widespread panic, social unrest or large-scale disorder”.

Propagating false or misleading information around COVID-19 diagnostic criteria or procedures such as “if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you do not have coronavirus,” will also be removed from the platform.

Claims that specific groups, nationalities are never susceptible to COVID-19, such as “people with dark skin are immune to COVID-19 due to melanin production” or “reading the Quran will make an individual immune to COVID-19” will also be purged, said Twitter.

Earlier, Youtube had announced that it had taken down thousands of videos related to dangerous or misleading coronavirus information using its Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technology.

In a blog post, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that since January, Google has blocked hundreds of thousands of ads attempting to capitalize on the coronavirus pandemic. “Last week, we announced a temporary ban on all ads for medical masks and respirators,” he said on Monday.

“We continue to remove videos that promote medically unproven methods to prevent coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment. On Google Maps, our automated and manual review systems continue to take down false and harmful content such as fake reviews and misleading information about healthcare locations,” Pichai elaborated.

Facebook to put corona info on top of users’ News Feed

Meanwhile, Facebook has said that it will put vetted information about novel coronavirus at the top of users’ New Feed to tackle the spread of fake health information.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that a collection of information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will begin appearing on top of the feed in the coming days, reports TechCrunch.

“We’re going to be putting it at the top of everyone’s Facebook feed,” Zuckerberg said in a press call on Wednesday.

Facebook will also roll out its own coronavirus information hub on the social network. The information hub would be up in “a number” of US locations and some in Europe in the next 24 hours, with a more global rollout later.

“Were designing it to be very adaptive on a day to day basis,” said Zuckerberg.

Facebook also announced it would make its enterprise connectivity platform ‘Workplace’ free for the government and for emergency services.
